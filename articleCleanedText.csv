The eighth case of coronavirus confirmed in the US is a student at University of Massachusetts Boston, public health officials in Massachusetts said during a call with reporters today.
The man had recently returned from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.
The case poses no increased risk to other students on the university’s campus, said Dr. Jennifer Lo, medical director of the Boston Public Health Commission.
She added that the student, a man in his 20s, is currently “doing quite well” and is being quarantined at his home, which is not in a dorm on campus.
He is being monitored by public health nurses who are calling him regularly.
“We won’t release him from isolation until we are satisfied it’s safe to do so,” said Dr. Larry Madoff, medical director of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences.
“He returned to Boston directly from China through Logan Airport.
He returned on the 28th of January, recognized quickly that he was ill and sought medical attention.
He had only been ill for a brief period of time when he arrived,” Madoff said.
“Active screening had not yet begun at Logan at that time.” The patient had a runny nose when he arrived in Boston, health officials said, and has been in isolation since he sought medical care on Jan. 29.
Madoff said he could count the patient’s close contacts “on our fingers,” and contacts are household members and medical personnel who treated the man.
All public health officials on the call emphasized that the overall risk to residents in Massachusetts remains low.
The eighth confirmed US case of the coronavirus is a “member of the UMass Boston community,” the school said in a statement today.

An evacuee from Wuhan, China who arrived at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in Southern California was transported to a local hospital after developing a fever or a cough, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement Thursday.
The adult was sent to UC San Diego Health, according to the statement.
So far, a total of five evacuees from the base have been transported for further evaluation.
Singapore and Taiwan confirmed new cases of coronavirus on Thursday.
Three new coronavirus cases were reported in Taiwan, bringing the total to 16, according to a statement from the Ministry of Health and Welfare.
In Singapore, two additional coronavirus cases were confirmed, increasing the total number in the country to 30, according to a statement from the Ministry of Health.
Italy has confirmed its third case of coronavirus after an Italian national tested positive for the infection, the country's health ministry said Thursday.
The patient is the first Italian to have the virus after its first two cases were from Chinese tourists.
According to the statement, the patient was quarantined in the city of Cecchignola, a historically known military district on the outskirts of Rome, after being repatriated from Wuhan last week.
The patient is currently being treated at Lazzaro Spallanzani Institute, an infectious disease hospital in Rome, where they have a slight “temperature and conjunctival hyperemia,"" the statement said.
The death toll in China's Hubei province now stands at 618, and the total number of confirmed cases has increased to 22,112, the health authority in Hubei province announced Thursday.
The health authority reported that 15,804 patients remain hospitalized, of which 841 are in critical condition.
Li Wenliang, the Chinese whistleblower doctor who was reprimanded by Wuhan Police after warning the public of a potential ""SARS-like"" disease in December 2019, died of coronavirus in Wuhan in the early hours of Friday morning (local time), according to a statement from Wuhan Central Hospital.
“Our hospital's ophthalmologist Li Wenliang was unfortunately infected with coronavirus during his work in the fight against the coronavirus epidemic,” the statement read.
“He died at 2:58 a.m. on Feb 7 after attempts to resuscitate were unsuccessful.” The statement came after hours of confusion over Li’s status.
Earlier on Thursday, several state media outlets reported Li’s death, following Chinese social media erupting into profound grief and anger.
A short time later, Wuhan Central Hospital released a statement saying Li was still alive and in critical condition, adding that they were “making attempts to resuscitate him.” State media subsequently deleted their previous tweets.
About Li: After he alerted colleagues in December, Li was questioned by local health authorities and was later summoned by Wuhan police to sign a reprimand letter in which he was accused of ""spreading rumors online"" and ""severely disrupting social order."" Li was one of several medics targeted by police for trying to blow the whistle on the deadly virus in the early weeks of the outbreak, which has sickened more than 28,000 people and killed more than 560.
He later contracted the virus himself.
Li was hospitalized on Jan. 12 and tested positive for the coronavirus on Feb. 1.
The Defense Department expects to announce today that 11 additional military housing locations have been approved to accept people for quarantine if public health authorities believe there are coronavirus concerns, according to two US officials.
The request for the additional military housing has come from the Department of Health and Human Services and has been preliminarily approved by the Pentagon.
The list of housing sites has not yet been made public but they are located near 11 designated commercial airports where planes carrying US citizens who have recently been in China must land, the officials said.
The expectation is relatively small numbers of people will have to be housed as they come off those commercial flights, officials said.
Health authorities will be in charge of making those decisions.
The request estimates about 20 beds per site may be needed.
The officials said these will be sites used after other military sites and public health sites are full.
This is different than the initial charter flights flying from mainland China directly to military facilities where the Pentagon was told to be ready for approximately 1,000 people, the officials said.
The United Kingdom's chief medical officer urged anyone who has traveled to countries affected by the coronavirus in the last 14 days to stay indoors, ""even if symptoms are mild."" The UK updated its public health advice for anyone who is returning to the UK from Thailand, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Macao or mainland China and is experiencing cough or fever or shortness of breath.
“These areas have been identified because of the volume of air travel from affected areas, understanding of other travel routes and number of reported cases.
Our advice for travellers from Wuhan and Hubei Province remains unchanged,” the Department of Health’s website said in the statement.
The advisory was updated on Thursday — the same day that a third case of coronavirus was confirmed in the UK.

None of the evacuees from China who arrived at San Antonio’s Lackland Air Force Base are sick, according to an official with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The passengers were men, women and children and had either been living in, or traveled to, Hubei province.
Some of the passengers were then loaded back onto the plane and will continue on to Omaha, Nebraska.
Fewer than 100 of the passengers will be kept at the air force base.
All the evacuees will be under federal quarantined for 14 days from the time the plane left China.
McQuiston added that the goal of the CDC is to protect the health of US citizens.
Norwegian Cruise Lines is prohibiting passengers or staff that have Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passports on board any of the ships over concerns of spreading the coronavirus, the company said in a statement.
""Any guest who exhibits symptoms of any respiratory illness while on board will be subject to additional screening at our onboard Medical Center and may be subject to potential quarantine and disembarkation,"" the company said.
The new policy also said that guests who have traveled from, visited or transited via airports in China, including Hong Kong and Macau, within 30 days of their voyage will also not be allowed to board any of its ships.
Yesterday, Royal Caribbean imposed the same bans and restrictions on its cruise ships.
More from Norwegian Cruise Lines: The standard incubation period for coronavirus according to the World Health Organization and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is 14 days, Norwegian said.
Guests who are denied boarding will be issued a refund when they provide proof of travel, the company said.
A scientist working on developing a coronavirus vaccine says that the treatment would, at the earliest, be available in early 2021.
Robin Shattock, the head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, told The Brief’s Bianca Nobilo that his team was sharing information with teams of scientists across the world in the race to develop a workable vaccine.
“The earliest a vaccine could possibly [be] available for global use would be early next year.
That sounds slow – it’s still faster than it’s been done before.” Shattock also told CNN that “basic hygiene methods [were] the most effective ways to reduce transmission” of coronavirus.
He added that wearing masks only provided limited protection from the infection.
“The evidence that masks are protective is very slim,” he said.
“We don’t have strong evidence that they do much in terms of protection…they might reduce transmission just because it prevents you touching your face more often.” Shattock said use of masks by members of the public could cause stock shortages in hospitals."" Royal Caribbean said in a statement that ""none of the four guests being tested by CDC"" who were aboard the ship that docked in New Jersey ""showed any clinical signs or symptoms of coronavirus."" The companies statement said one passenger ""had tested positive onboard for Influenza A."" The company said their records indicate ""the guests had not been in China since January 26 - 14 days ago."" Royal Caribbean says it will now have stricter protocols which will include ""mandatory specialized health screenings performed"" on guests who report ""feeling unwell"" or with ""flu-like symptoms,"" anyone who traveled through mainland ""China or Hong Kong in the past 15 days,"" or had contact with someone who did.

At least 61 passengers — including 11 Americans — aboard a cruise ship in Japan have been infected with the coronavirus.
The number of cases on the ship tripled overnight from 20 to 61, CNN's Will Ripley reports.
Ripley reports that passengers aboard the ship have to stay inside 23 hours a day.
One of the Americans who tested positive for coronavirus spoke to Ripley.
Like not in a million years."" What we know about this ship: The Diamond Princess is anchored off the coast of Yokohama, near Tokyo, with 1,045 crew and 2,666 passengers — including 428 Americans — on board.
The vessel has been quarantined since Tuesday, and passengers are expected to remain under quarantine for at least 14 days — so roughly 11 more days.
This ship is one of three cruise ships in Asia have had their travels disrupted during the coronavirus outbreak.
Another ship is docked in Hong Kong and under quarantine as officials try to slow the spreading of the virus.
A third ship in the East China Sea has been unable to dock because of outbreak fears.
A new study turns a spotlight on the possible risk of hospital-related transmissions of the Wuhan coronavirus.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA today, involved analyzing data on 138 patients hospitalized with novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China.
The data showed that hospital-related transmissions of the virus were suspected in about 41% of the patients.
Specifically, 40 health care workers in the study and 17 patients who were already hospitalized for other reasons were presumed to have been infected with the novel coronavirus in the hospital, the data showed, also revealing that 26% of all the patients were admitted to an intensive care unit and 4.3% died.
The researchers noted that the new study, to their knowledge, might be the largest case series to date of hospitalized patients with novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia — but the study had some limitations.
Hospital-related transmissions of infections ""could not be definitively proven but was suspected and presumed based on timing and patterns of exposure to infected patients and subsequent development of infection,” the researchers wrote in the study.
Among the 138 cases, ""most patients are still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission.
About one in six people under investigation for Wuhan coronavirus in the United States have had “close contact” with someone confirmed to have been infected, according to a report released today by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
About 11% had contact with another person under investigation had not yet been confirmed to have the virus.
The majority, about 70%, had only travel-related risk.
Of them, most had traveled to Wuhan, versus other parts of China.
The numbers come from 210 people who were under investigation from Jan. 21 to Jan. 31, when CDC updated its guidelines.
All of the people were symptomatic — typically with fever and respiratory symptoms — and thus tested for the virus.
The CDC says these numbers are likely to change.
""Because person-to-person transmission is expected to continue, and as further travel restrictions are implemented, it is likely that the proportion of [people under investigation] with such contact risk in the United States will increase,” the report says.
On Friday, the CDC posted its latest total of people under investigation since January 21: A total of 337 people in 36 states.
This includes 12 who have tested positive, 225 negative and 100 are still pending.

The global death toll from the Wuhan coronavirus is at least 805, surpassing the number of fatalities from the deadly 2003 SARS outbreak.
When severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) swept through the region, it infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774.
Like SARS, this latest outbreak is caused by a coronavirus, a family of viruses common to animals that range from the common cold, to more serious diseases, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
Both the SARS and Wuhan outbreaks started in China -- and both are believed to have originated from wild animal markets.
The coronavirus death toll in the Chinese province of Hubei has risen to 780, according to the local health authority.
That's an increase of 81 people from the day before.
The total number of confirmed cases in Hubei jumped to 27,000.
There are more than 20,000 patients hospitalized in Hubei province and 1,154 are in critical condition.

“This was the first time in my life that I truly wept to the point of being sick in my body,” Ivy Cleveland told CNN.
""I just laid over her bed, over her crib that I had prepared for her and look up at the pictures in the wall, and her clothes in her closet, understanding that this is not happening right now.” Last month, the State Department issued the highest-level warning not to travel to China due to the coronavirus outbreak and recommended that US citizens defer travel for adoption purposes.
“We strongly recommend that U.S. citizens defer travel to China for adoption purposes and that prospective adoptive parents contact their adoption service providers to discuss future plans,” the department said on January 31.
The Clevelands are unsure when they will able travel to China, but said they are not ready to give up their adoption process.
“I know this is just a part of our story, it’s part of Ruby’s story and how incredible will it be to tell her ‘look what we did to fight for you,’” Noah Cleveland said.

The World Health Organization will send an international team to investigate the coronavirus outbreak to China, with the team leader leaving for China on Monday or Tuesday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference in Geneva on Saturday.
Ghebreyesus said the rest of the experts on the team will follow “after that.” When asked whether the international team will include officials from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Ghebreyesus said, “We hope so.” From Dr. Tom Frieden A study published Friday in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that 41% of the first 138 patients diagnosed at one hospital in Wuhan, China, were presumed to be infected in that hospital.
In plain English, it means that nearly half of the initial infections in this hospital appear to have been spread within the hospital itself.
(Doctors use big words to hide bad things: Nosocomial means caught it in the hospital.) What's more, most spread doesn't appear to have been the result of a so-called ""super-spreader event,"" in which a single patient transmits infection to many other people.
In these — where a doctor inserts a tube into the patient's lungs — can result in many infections.
This would be a concern, but not nearly as much as what appears to have happened: Many health care workers and many patients got infected in many parts of the hospital.
What's more, since there's a broad spectrum of infection and only patients who were sick were tested, it's quite likely that there was even more transmission in the hospital.
So, like SARS and MERS — other coronaviruses — before it, the Wuhan coronavirus is spreading in hospitals.
What does this mean?
The virus appears to be quite infectious, health care workers are at especially high risk, and we urgently need more information about just how infectious the virus is.
The virus might well be impossible to contain — just as the common cold and influenza can't be stopped, but the health and societal impacts can be blunted.
China's extraordinary efforts to stop the spread of the virus, even if unsuccessful, may slow its spread and improve China and the world's ability to limit the harm the virus causes.

WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the team will ""lay the groundwork for larger international team"" who will join them “as soon as possible.” The team could range between 10 and 15.
On Sunday, as the team departed for China, Director-General Ghebreyesus said on Twitter the international expert mission to China will be ""led by Dr. Bruce Aylward, veteran of past public health emergencies."" Aylward lead the WHO’s response to Ebola, as well as initiatives for immunization, communicable diseases control and polio eradication.
The newly unveiled Trump administration budget proposal includes steep cuts for global health programs and the World Health Organization, even as the world grapples with the spread of the novel coronavirus.
However, it does increase its proposed funding for Global Health Security.
The FY21 Budget Proposal, released today, outlines a nearly $65M proposed cut to the World Health Organization – a more than 50% decrease from FY20 funding.
It also proposes a 34% overall cut to Global Health Programs.
It includes a proposed $115 million for Global Health Security aimed at enabling “the U.S. government, in partnership with other nations, international organizations, and public and private stakeholders, to prevent avoidable epidemics, detect threats early, and respond rapidly and effectively to disease outbreaks and other critical infectious disease threats (including anti-microbial resistance) in an effort to prevent them from becoming national or global emergencies.” This is an increase of $25 million from last year’s request.
Asked by CNN about the impact the WHO cut could have on the global coronavirus response, the Director of the Department of State’s Bureau of Budget & Planning downplayed the potential negative consequences.
Jim Richardson, the Director of US Foreign Assistance Resources at the State Department, said the US was the “largest donor overall to global health around the world.” “We do think that it’s important to balance the multilateral against the bilateral assistance,” Richardson said.
“Both are important, but it is important for us to make sure that we get the appropriate reform to the multilateral while delivering the best assistance that we possibly can on the ground, and that’s often through bilateral.” Deputy Secretary of State Steve Biegun claimed that the budget bolsters “country capacity to prevent, detect and respond to outbreaks and to prevent epidemics from reaching our borders.” “It also allows us to provide the necessary flexibility to respond to emerging global health threats such as the novel coronavirus and Ebola,” he said at the State Department.
Biegun praised the State Department and USAID efforts in responding to the novel coronavirus.
No one from the first group of Americans evacuated from Wuhan has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to Riverside County Health Officials.
The group of passengers arrived at the base on Jan. 29 after arriving from China.
Many of the passengers work for the US State Department or are related to someone who does.
They have been isolated from base personnel and were not permitted to leave the fenced quarantine area.
They have been on a 14-day quarantine that expires on Tuesday, and they will be free to leave March Air Reserve Base if they do not display any symptoms.

Health officials in Hong Kong are conducting a partial evacuation of residents from an apartment block following possibility that the coronavirus may have been transmitted via the building piping system, Professor KY Yuen said during an impromptu midnight press conference held on Tuesday morning local time.
Health officials have traced at least two confirmed cases of the coronavirus to the specific residential building called Hong Mei House in the Tsing Yi area of Hong Kong.
""As the pipeline that transfers feces is connected to the air pipe, it is very likely for the virus in the feces to be transmitted through the air fan into the toilet,"" Professor Yuen said.
Parts of the building were evacuated as a precaution while health officials and engineers carried out emergency checks, he added.
Professor Yuen said that the transmission route is not clear yet, so the evacuation was taken to protect the residents of the building.
This comes as local health officials confirmed that both the 42nd confirmed and latest case in the city and the 12th confirmed patient both lived in Hong Mei House.

It's too early to predict the end of the current novel coronavirus outbreak, said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's health emergencies program.
The number of new coronavirus cases being reported out of China has appeared to slow down.
""The number of newly confirmed cases reported from China has stabilized over the past week, but that must be interpreted with extreme caution.
This outbreak could still go in any direction,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during the news conference.
At the news conference, Ryan said that the stabilization in cases is “reassuring” and is the ""result of the huge public health operation in China.” WHO on Wednesday reported 44,730 cases of coronavirus in China, with 1,114 deaths.
Outside of China, there are 441 cases and one death, according to WHO.
The number of novel coronavirus deaths has risen to 1,115, out of 45,171 cases diagnosed globally, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus  said in a news conference on Wednesday.

He also said that the number of confirmed cases reported from China has “declined steadily for the past week, but that must be interpreted with extreme caution.” The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is taking steps to help prevent the possible spread of the novel coronavirus in the United States and prepare for an outbreak here, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a call with reporters on Wednesday.
""This will require the effort of all levels of government, the public health system and our communities as we face these challenges together,” Messonnier said.
""One important aspect of this is taking steps to make sure there are enough supplies and appropriate guidance to prevent spread of the disease, especially among health care personnel caring for patients.” Some of the steps the CDC has taken include speaking regularly with manufacturers of medical supplies, including personal protective equipment or PPE, such as face masks, to make sure that enough supplies are available in case they are needed.
""CDC does not currently recommend the use of face masks for the general public.
This virus is not spreading in the community,” Messonnier said.
But in an effort to make sure enough supplies are available in case of an outbreak in the United States, “CDC talks regularly with health care industry partners as well as PPE manufacturers and distributors to assess availability of PPE.
At this time, some partners are reporting higher than usual demand for select N95 respirators and face masks,” Messonnier said.

President Trump on Friday repeated the theory that the novel coronavirus will die out as temperatures rise in the spring, but scientists insist it’s just too soon to say for sure.
Several tell CNN it’s too early to tell, and nobody knows enough about the novel coronavirus to make assessments about its behavior.
CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told CNN in an interview, which aired Thursday, that the coronavirus may or may not be around past this year and it may or may not follow a seasonal variation — insisting only time will tell.
""We don't know a lot about this virus,"" he said.
""This virus is probably with us beyond this season, beyond this year, and I think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we will get community-based transmission."" Trump also estimated that there were “around 12” confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the US.
As of Friday, 15 individuals tested by the CDC tested positive for the coronavirus.
US officials are working together to make a plan for Americans on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, a director at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters on Friday.
There is no specific plan yet for the passengers, she said, but precautions are needed for the passengers — who may be at high risk from the novel coronavirus — and to avoid spread to others.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not yet returned to shipping coronavirus test kits to state labs after some tests were initially found to be faulty, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Friday during a call with reporters.
The CDC wants to make sure that “every T is crossed before we put these kits back out, so we’re taking a little extra time here,” Messonnier said.
Why this matters: Earlier this week, the agency said some state labs had been unable to validate the test.
The CDC is now remanufacturing a reagent used in the test that was yielding “indeterminate answers,” Messonnier said.
""What we’re doing at CDC is reformulating those reagents,” she said, ""and we are moving quickly to get those back out to our labs” with state and local partners.
Before it began shipping these kits, the CDC was the only lab in the United States that could test for the virus.
Experts say the new test kits open the door to confirming cases earlier, thus being able to take swift action to contain any further spread in the United States.
The CDC had previously announced plans to ship roughly 200 test kits to domestic labs and another 200 to international labs.
Each test kit can perform 700 to 800 patient samples.
Public health labs in five cities will begin using existing flu surveillance to look for the spread of the novel coronavirus, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a call with reporters today.
Messonnier said this efficiently leverages the existing influenza surveillance systems to track whether the novel coronavirus is spreading in communities within the United States.
The labs will test for the coronavirus in samples that are negative for influenza.
Results from this will provide an early warning to trigger a change in the public health response, Messonnier said.

Delivery robots are in high demand among retailers after many employees have not been able to return to work due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.
Our engineers have been working remotely, and we hope to start production next week and solve the current supply and demand problem,"" said Liu Zhiyong, the CEO of ZhenRobotics.
Here’s how China's companies are trying to get back to business amid the outbreak.
The novel coronavirus has spread throughout the world since the first cases were detected in central China in December, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Meanwhile, a number of countries, such as the United States and Japan, have evacuated their nationals on flights from Wuhan, capital of the Hubei province and the epicenter of the outbreak.
More than 66,000 cases of novel coronavirus have been reported in mainland China since Dec. 31.
Here's a map showing where the confirmed cases are, according to data from the World Health Organization: The first case of coronavirus involving the Westerdam cruise ship was confirmed by Malaysia on Saturday, after an 83-year-old US citizen tested positive, according to a report from state media Bernama.
Several Asian countries refused to let the Westerdam dock in their ports before being allowed to disembark in Cambodia on Friday.
The cruise ship, which had a total of 1,455 guests and 802 crew onboard was not under quarantine, Holland America Line said last week.
All passengers and crew members onboard the cruise ship were allowed to return to their respective countries by the Cambodian government after they successfully passed through health screenings.
The US citizen and her husband, also American, were found to have symptoms as soon as they landed at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport from Cambodia, Bernama added.
They were referred to the Sungai Buloh hospital for examination, which concluded that the woman tested positive while her husband, age 85, tested negative.
The husband is still undergoing treatment and observation at the hospital for his symptoms.
The total tally of confirmed cases in Malaysia is now up to 22, according to a report from state media Bernama.
CNN has reached out to the State Department for a comment.
US citizens aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan will undergo extensive screening and a 14 day quarantine period should they choose to disembark.
On Saturday, US passengers received an email from the State Department urging them to leave the ship and return to the United States.
There are currently some 400 US citizens aboard the Diamond Princess.
The State Department will provide chartered flights for those who choose to leave.
Passengers choosing to fly back aboard the charter will be screened before they leave the ship and monitored by medical personnel during their return to the US, according to a news release from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Once back in the country, passengers will undergo a 14 day quarantine period at either Travis Air Base in California or Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas.
The passengers returning from Japan will be housed separately from those evacuated from China at the same bases.
More context: So far at least 24 Americans aboard the ship have tested positive for the novel coronavirus aboard the ship.
Americans who have already tested positive for coronavirus, as well as those showing symptoms of the virus, will not be able to board the charter aircraft back to the United States, and will continue to receive treatment in Japan.
An American couple from Oregon who traveled in the Diamond Princess cruise ship that's docked at the Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama have had their hopes of coming home dashed.
Rebecca Frasure has tested positive for the virus, which means she can’t board a flight to the US and has to remain in quarantine at a nearby hospital.
Her husband Kent remains on the cruise ship and it's unclear what he will do.
I was so sure that this was going to come out negative.
I was so sure that this was going to come out negative,” Rebecca Frasure told CNN.
Getting out: The US is sending charter planes to evacuate US citizens and their families Sunday evening local time.
Those who choose to fly back on the planes will be quarantined for 14 days once they arrive.
The Japanese government said it “appreciates” the US decision to offer voluntary evacuation to American citizens and their immediate family on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Saturday.
Evacuation flights: The United States is sending charter planes to evacuate US citizens and their families Sunday evening local time.

There were 100 more deaths due to the coronavirus in China's Hubei province Sunday, the health authorities there said.
That raises the death toll at the center of the outbreak to 1,696.
The global death toll now stands at 1,770, with the vast majority of those deaths in mainland China.
More than 1,900 additional cases of the virus were confirmed Sunday, Hubei authorities said, bringing the total number of cases in the center of the outbreak to 58,182.
The global tally: There have been more than 71,204 cases of the virus recorded worldwide, with the vast majority in mainland China.
China’s National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China’s provinces later.
Authorities in the United States acknowledged reports that an 83-year-old American woman in Malaysia contracted the novel coronavirus while on a cruise ship, a State Department official said.
More than 300 passengers, mostly American citizens, from the Diamond Princess cruise ship are aboard the two airplanes chartered by the US government, a State Department spokesperson told CNN.
In its communications to passengers on the cruise ship Saturday, the US embassy in Tokyo said American citizens would be able to bring their non-American immediate relatives.
All travelers were screened for symptoms of coronavirus prior to departure and will be screened by staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention upon arrival in the United States, another State Department spokesperson said in a statement.
""Only those who were asymptomatic were allowed to board the flights,” the spokesperson said.
“Our primary goal remains ensuring the welfare and safety of all US citizens involved,” the spokesperson added.
“The Department of State has no higher priority than the welfare and safety of US citizens abroad.” Two airplanes chartered by the United States government to evacuate American passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have departed Tokyo.
The first plane is heading to Kelly Field/Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.
The second plane is going to Travis Air Force Base in Solano County, California.
The planes took off more than four hours after 10 buses brought the passengers from the cruise ship in Yokohama to Haneda Airport in Tokyo.
US officials have not discussed the number of people who asked for a seat on the charters.
Singapore has identified three new cases of the novel coronavirus, bringing the citywide total to 75 confirmed cases, the country's health ministry said.
None of those patients have traveled to China recently, the ministry said.
As of Sunday, a total of 19 patients have fully recovered from the virus and have been discharged from the hospital.
Dr. John Wiesman, the health secretary in Washington state -- where the first US case of Wuhan coronavirus was confirmed -- says the public should do ""what you do every cold and flu season."" That includes washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
But don't use your hands.
Use either your bent elbow or a tissue that you throw away immediately afterward.
WHO also recommends staying at least 3 feet or 1 meter away from anyone who may be infected.
Is there a cure for novel coronavirus?
No. Patients can be treated and may recover from their symptoms, but there is no known cure for the novel coronavirus yet.
A large group of Americans who were on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan were spotted boarding a chartered flight at the Haneda Airport in Tokyo.

Hong Kong's Department of Health announced that it will prosecute two people suspected of violating compulsory quarantine requirements.
In a statement released on Monday, the Department of Health said that since the compulsory quarantine began on February 8, four Hong Kong residents under quarantine have attempted to leave Hong Kong in breach of the requirements.
The Department of Health added that following investigations, the department applied to serve summons to two of the people involved.
According to quarantine regulation, all travelers who have been in mainland China within 14 days preceding their arrival in Hong Kong must be subject to a 14-day quarantine.
If convicted of violating the quarantine regulation, the two Hong Kong residents face a maximum fine of $3,220 and up to six months in prison.
Five additional deaths were reported in mainland China on Monday, increasing the death toll there to 98, according to China’s National Health Commission (NHC).
Of the 98 deaths reported Monday, 93 were in Hubei Province.
The additional five deaths across all of mainland China brings the death toll to 1,868 in China.
That brings the global death toll to 1,873.
There have been five deaths reported outside of mainland China with one death in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and France.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the risk of coronavirus in the US is ""really very minimal because there really are only 15 cases now, in addition to those who were shipped here."" In an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Monday, he went on to say the cases ""were identified, they were isolated and the contacts were traced.” He said the soonest a vaccine for the novel coronavirus could make it through the development process and clinical trials is “at least a year to a year and a half.” The Hubei health authority reported that 93 more people died of the coronavirus in Hubei province on Monday, raising the death toll in the epicenter since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak to 1,789.
This brings the total number of deaths in mainland China to at least 1,863.
The global death toll is at least 1,868, with one death each in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and France.
Hubei authorities confirmed an additional 1,807 cases of the virus in Hubei on Monday, which brings the total number of cases in the epicenter of the outbreak to 59,989.
According to the health authority, 41,957 patients have been hospitalized in Hubei, including 1,853 who are in critical condition.
The health authority said 7,862 patients have been discharged.
The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases now exceeds 73,243 with the vast majority of cases in mainland China.
China’s National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China’s provinces later.
Concerns are mounting about how long the novel coronavirus may survive on surfaces — so much so that China's central bank has taken measures to deep clean and destroy its cash, which changes hands multiple times a day, in an effort to contain the virus.
It is unknown exactly how long the novel coronavirus can linger on contaminated surfaces and objects with the potential of infecting people, but some researchers are finding clues by studying the elusive behaviors of other coronaviruses.
About the virus: Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses common among animals.
In rare cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Officials do not know what animal may have caused the current outbreak of novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.
But previously, studies have suggested that people were infected with the coronavirus MERS, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, after coming in contact with camels, and scientists have suspected that civet cats were to blame for SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.
These human coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, have been found to persist on inanimate surfaces — including metal, glass or plastic surfaces — for as long as nine days if that surface had not been disinfected, according to research published earlier this month in The Journal of Hospital Infection.
Cleaning with common household products can make a difference, according to the research, which also found that human coronaviruses ""can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite"" or bleach within one minute.
CNN's Randi Kaye, who is filling in for Anderson Cooper today on ""Full Circle,"" talks to an American who stayed on the Diamond Princess cruise ship instead of taking a charter flight to the US.

The Trump administration has prevented at least 140 travelers from entering the United States as it attempts to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Fourteen foreign nationals were turned away at US airports and 126 people were refused entry at land ports from February 2 to 12, according to data provided to CNN by the Department of Homeland Security.
Additionally, 34 travelers were stopped at pre-clearance locations — airports where US officials conduct screening before passengers board US-bound flights.
More on this: On February 2, the US began implementing stringent travel restrictions that include temporarily denying entry to foreign nationals who visited China in the 14 days prior to their arrival in the US.
US citizens returning from China are also subject to health screenings and potential quarantine.
Those US citizens and others traveling to the US from China are being funneled through 11 airports where authorities can conduct additional screening and transfer people for quarantine if needed.
Last summer, as the Ebola virus threat was emerging from the Democratic Republic of Congo, DHS' Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office implemented plans to provide enhanced airport screening at multiple airports throughout the United States.
The department retrofitted its Ebola response plan to deal with the coronavirus outbreak, according to DHS.
Customs officers referred 43,263 air travelers for potential secondary screening since the efforts began on February 2.
Of those referred at airports, 23,836 required secondary screening, according to the data.
Personnel has been added to deal with the virus as well.
Around 95 CWMD contractors are employed per day across the 11 airports to conduct medical screenings.
As of February 12, 19 DHS personnel were assigned to the US Department of Health and Human Services operations center.
There are also 150-200 Customs and Border Protection officers assisting with screening daily at the 11 airports.

17,"Japan has seven new cases of novel coronavirus, the Ministry of Health announced on Tuesday.
About the cases: The new cases include a teen in Wakayama and a male doctor in his thirties who went on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
In Japan, a total of 613 novel coronavirus cases have been confirmed, with 545 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship and 68 outside the ship.
German researchers called symptom-based screening to detect the novel coronavirus “ineffective” in a new analysis published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The researchers assessed the screening process for 126 people evacuated to Germany from Wuhan, China.
All 126 travelers, mostly German nationals, left Wuhan on February 1 and were screened for symptoms and clinical signs of infection before they were evacuated.
Despite requiring travelers to undergo a multiple screenings once in Germany, two travelers were ultimately positive for the novel coronavirus.
According to the researchers, “a symptom-based screening process was ineffective in detecting” the virus.
During the evacuation flight from Germany, 10 passengers were isolated: two because of contact with a confirmed coronavirus patient; six exhibited symptoms; and two passengers who had accompanied one of the six symptomatic travelers.
Upon arrival, all 10 of these passengers were transferred to University Hospital Frankfurt and all tested negative for coronavirus.
This patient ultimately tested negative for coronavirus.
Of the remaining 115 patients, 114 consented to a throat swab to test for coronavirus.
Of those 114 travelers, two tested positive for coronavirus.
These two patients were isolated at a hospital.
According to the researchers, the two isolated patients were “well” and had no fever in the seven days after hospitalization.
Aside from the ineffectiveness of the screening process, the authors found that the virus could potentially be spread by those who exhibited mild symptoms: “Shedding of potentially infectious virus may occur in persons who have no fever and no signs or only minor signs of infection.” Over 73,000 people around the world have been infected with the coronavirus, most of those cases in mainland China.
There have been more than 1,800 deaths, including five people outside of mainland China.
More than 2,000 people have died from coronavirus across the globe, according to the latest figures released Tuesday.
China’s National Health Commission (NHC) reported Tuesday that 136 more people died of coronavirus in mainland China, 132 of which occurred in the Hubei province.
The latest figures brings the total number of deaths in mainland China to 2,004, and the global death toll to 2,009.
There have been five deaths reported outside of mainland China with one death in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and France.
The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases now stands at 75,117, with the majority of cases in mainland China.
China’s National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China’s provinces later.
Since the start of the novel coronavirus outbreak in December, the disease has infected more than 70,000 people and has reached a death toll of 1,868 people in mainland China.
According to analysis done by CNN, travel restrictions, of varying degrees are still being enforced in various provinces and cities across mainland China including Hubei, Liaoning, Beijing and Shanghai affecting over 780 million people.
These restrictions, which appear to be China's main effort to control the disease, include everything from self-quarantines to limits on who can come and go from neighborhoods.
Despite the continuation of its spread, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said that the virus is not as deadly as SARS or MERS, both of which are related to the current coronavirus, and more than 80% of patients ""have mild disease and will recover."" Reports say it could take up to 18 months before a coronavirus vaccine is available.
Here's a look at where the cases are throughout mainland China, according to WHO data.
These numbers may differ from those reported by Chinese health officials, who report updated totals at different times than the WHO.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a statement criticizing the quarantine efforts taken on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
The CDC noted that there are still more than 100 US citizens on board the ship or in hospitals in Japan.
Due to their high-risk exposure, there is the potential for additional novel coronavirus cases to occur and the remaining passengers who disembark from the ship will  be subject to a 14-day quarantine.
The 13 patients who arrived at the University of Nebraska Medical Center from the Diamond Princess cruise ship are receiving supportive care, Dr. Mark Rupp, chief of the hospital's Division of Infectious Diseases, told CNN.
He also noted that while the mortality rate for the virus is being calculated at around 2%, he expects that number to eventually fall.
The Russian government announced that it would temporarily suspend entry by Chinese citizens, according to an order posted on an official state website today.
The statement said Russia would bar entry through its state border to Chinese citizens entering for work, for private, educational and tourist purposes.
The order says the processing of documents, registration and invitations to Chinese citizens to enter Russian territory for those reasons would cease temporarily from midnight Tuesday; the full ban takes effect Thursday.
Some background: This announcement comes amid concerns over the novel coronavirus.
Russia is a major destination and transit point for Chinese tourists, and shares a lengthy land border with China.
The new restrictions will not apply to transit passengers, Russian state news agency TASS said.
The Russian government has reported two cases of the coronavirus involving Chinese citizens in Russia and confirmed that a Russian woman was diagnosed with the virus on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess.
With a majority of some US medical supplies coming from or originating in China, coronavirus could hold ""chilling implications"" by hindering that pipeline, according to Robert P.
Kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the US Department of Health and Human Services.
About timing: The US might not see the impacts just yet because American buyers typically stock up before Chinese factories slow down during the Lunar New Year, Kadlec added.
These concerns extend not just to pharmaceuticals but also to other materials like face masks, which are frequently manufactured in China.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend the use of face masks for the general American public.
By buying them up in large quantities, Kadlec warned that Americans might leave fewer for some people who really need them — namely, health care workers.
Kadlec said, ""We probably need to change the way we do business in these areas because of the significant risks and vulnerabilities that are being highlighted by this event."" He added that the solution requires a whole-government approach in cooperation with the private — ""It's everybody."" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed, saying, ""We can't see them crash.",2020-02-18,"['case', 'health', 'case', 'case', 'doctor', 'board', 'cruise', 'ship', 'case', 'cruise', 'ship', 'ship', 'researcher', 'call', 'symptom', 'screening', 'analysis', 'medicine', 'researcher', 'screening', 'process', 'people', 'traveler', 'screen', 'symptom', 'sign', 'infection', 'traveler', 'screening', 'traveler', 'researcher', 'symptom', 'screening', 'process', 'virus', 'evacuation', 'flight', 'passenger', 'contact', 'exhibit', 'symptom', 'passenger', 'traveler', 'arrival', 'passenger', 'transfer', 'university', 'hospital', 'test', 'test', 'consent', 'test', 'traveler', 'test', 'hospital', 'researcher', 'day', 'hospitalization', 'ineffectiveness', 'screening', 'process', 'author', 'virus', 'exhibit', 'symptom', 'virus', 'person', 'sign', 'sign', 'infection', 'people', 'world', 'case', 'mainland', 'death', 'people', 'mainland', 'people', 'figure', 'release', 'health', 'report', 'people', 'mainland', 'figure', 'number', 'death', 'mainland', 'death', 'toll', 'death', 'report', 'mainland', 'death', 'number', 'case', 'case', 'mainland', 'health', 'release', 'number', 'people', 'death', 'toll', 'people', 'mainland', 'analysis', 'travel', 'restriction', 'degree', 'enforce', 'city', 'mainland', 'people', 'restriction', 'self', 'neighborhood', 'continuation', 'director', 'world', 'health', 'virus', 'mers', 'report', 'month', 'vaccine', 'case', 'mainland', 'number', 'report', 'health', 'report', 'update', 'time', 'centers', 'issue', 'statement', 'criticize', 'cruise', 'ship', 'citizen', 'board', 'ship', 'hospital', 'risk', 'exposure', 'case', 'passenger', 'ship', 'university', 'cruise', 'ship', 'care', 'hospital', 'division', 'diseases', 'rate', 'virus', 'calculate', 'number', 'government', 'entry', 'citizen', 'order', 'state', 'website', 'today', 'statement', 'bar', 'entry', 'state', 'border', 'citizen', 'work', 'tourist', 'purpose', 'order', 'processing', 'document', 'registration', 'invitation', 'citizen', 'territory', 'reason', 'cease', 'midnight', 'effect', 'background', 'announcement', 'concern', 'transit', 'point', 'tourist', 'share', 'land', 'border', 'restriction', 'transit', 'passenger', 'state', 'news', 'government', 'report', 'case', 'citizen', 'woman', 'virus', 'board', 'cruise', 'ship', 'supply', 'implication', 'pipeline', 'p.', 'assistant', 'preparedness', 'response', 'health', 'services', 'timing', 'impact', 'stock', 'factory', 'year', 'concern', 'pharmaceutical', 'material', 'face', 'centers', 'use', 'face', 'quantity', 'people', 'health', 'care', 'worker', 'change', 'way', 'business', 'area', 'risk', 'vulnerability', 'highlight', 'event', 'solution', 'government', 'cooperation', 'director', 'diseases', 'crash']"
18,"Our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak has moved here.
More than 2,100 people have died from coronavirus across the globe, according to the latest figures released Wednesday.
The Hubei health authority reported that 108 more people died of the coronavirus in Hubei province on Wednesday, raising the death toll in the epicenter since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak to 2,029.
The Hubei report brings the total number of deaths in mainland China to at least 2,112.
The global death toll from coronavirus has risen to at least 2,120, with eight deaths reported outside of mainland China.
Hong Kong and Iran have each reported two deaths from coronavirus.
Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and France have each reported one death.
The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases now exceeds 76,262, with the vast majority of cases in mainland China.
China’s National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China’s provinces later.
People with the novel coronavirus may have the same viral load — or amount of virus in the body — whether or not they are showing symptoms of illness, according to researchers in China.
The letter from the researchers, which was published in The New England Journal of Medicine, details how the researchers monitored viral loads of the novel coronavirus in samples taken from the nose and throat of 18 patients: nine men and nine women ranging in age from 26 to 76 in Zhuhai, in China’s Guangdong province.
For those samples, a total of 72 nasal swabs and 72 throat swabs were collected and analyzed.
The analysis revealed that higher viral loads were detected soon after a person was showing symptoms, with higher viral loads found in the nose than in the throat.
Yet overall, “the viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which suggests the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients,” the researchers wrote in the letter.
It also turned out that, when it comes to viral shedding, the novel coronavirus seemed to resemble influenza more than SARS, according to the letter.
How many affected: Globally, the World Health Organization has reported that there have been more than 75,000 laboratory or clinically confirmed cases of novel coronavirus and more than 2,000 deaths.
Since mid-January, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been employing temperature checks at selected airports, at first on people flying in from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, and now on all passengers who've been anywhere in mainland China in the past 14 days.
While the CDC has screened more than 30,000 passengers in the past month, not a single US coronavirus case has been caught by airport temperature checks, according to a CNN investigation.
CNN reviewed statements by local, state and federal health officials, and emailed and spoke with officials, to determine how many people eventually diagnosed with the novel coronavirus went through airport temperature checks.
By the numbers: Ten passengers flew into US airports on commercial airliners and were later diagnosed with coronavirus.
Four of those 10 passengers went through temperature checks and were found not to have a fever or any other symptoms of the virus.
Two of those passengers flew into Los Angeles International Airport and two flew into San Francisco International Airport.
Previously, a CDC spokesperson had told CNN that two of the passengers were symptomatic during flight, but the spokesperson later said they were asymptomatic while flying.
Another four out of the 10 passengers were not screened because they flew into airports that did not have screening at the time.
It's unclear whether the final two passengers went through temperature checks because health officials at the CDC and in Wisconsin and Arizona refused to say when asked by CNN.
How the screening works: The temperature checks are part of an overall screening effort that includes giving passengers cards telling them to watch out for fever, cough and trouble breathing, all symptoms of the novel coronavirus disease, also called COVID-19.
While airport temperature checks haven't caught any coronavirus cases, the information cards have helped catch US cases of the virus at least twice – once in a passenger who flew into San Francisco, and once in a passenger who flew into Los Angeles.
The cruise industry is “focused on protecting the health and safety of passengers and crew” amid the coronavirus outbreak, according to the industry’s largest trade group.
“The enhanced screening measures, the first of which were adopted within hours of the WHO declaring a global health emergency, do appear to be working and have enabled operations to continue as usual in many parts of the world,” said Bari Goin-Blaugrund, senior director of strategic communications of Cruise Lines International Association, or CLIA.
Goin-Blaugrund also said that within the global CLIA fleet of 272 cruise ships, only one has experienced any cases of coronavirus on board.
Passengers aboard that ship, the Diamond Princess in Japan, began disembarking Wednesday after a 14-day quarantine.
A total of 624 cases of the virus are linked to the stricken ship.
Analysts say the coronavirus could take a financial toll on the industry, especially in China.
If operators cancel cruises through March, JP Morgan predicts revenue could fall as much at 15%.
Shares for two of the biggest cruise operators — Royal Caribbean and Carnival — are down more than 16% and 14% this year, respectively.
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has calculated a case fatality rate of 2.3% for the novel coronavirus — meaning 2.3% of those known to be infected have died.
And remember: International experts have cautioned that early numbers may not tell the whole story.
Case fatality rates may come down as officials discover milder cases who don't seek medical care.
The president of the company that owns the stricken cruise ship Diamond Princess greeted disembarking passengers in Tokyo on Wednesday, acknowledging that customers had endured a ""challenging"" situation following an outbreak of coronavirus on the vessel.
""This is an unprecedented situation,"" Jan Swartz, President of Princess Cruises, said in an interview with CNN on Wednesday.
The Diamond Princess ship became a floating quarantine zone earlier this month.
Dozens of passengers tested positive for the novel coronavirus, effectively trapping more than 3,000 people, including 428 Americans, on board.
A total of 624 confirmed cases of the coronavirus have been linked to the boat -- the largest outbreak outside of China.
Japan’s government did not allow the roughly 1,000 crew members to be quarantined unless they took ill, instead asking them to work and serve the rest of the passengers throughout the two-week period.
“I think the guests and our crew who came together to help support each other, from 57 different countries and regions around the world really lifted each other's hearts, as did social media play a critical role in that.” ""Our guests shared stories about living in the cabin for 14 days, clearly it was an uncomfortable, challenging situation,"" Swartz added.
Even though the departing passengers have tested negative for the virus and endured the 14-day quarantine, there is mounting evidence from infectious disease experts that they could unknowingly be carrying the virus back into their communities.
On Monday, the United States evacuated more than 300 American passengers who had tested negative for the virus from the Diamond Princess, only to discover that more than a dozen of them were infected.
Canada, Australia and Hong Kong have arranged charter flights to take their citizens home after they leave the ship.
Princess Cruises, which operates a fleet of 20 ships, is the third largest cruise line in the world.
Because of the coronavirus outbreak onboard the Diamond Princess, the company has canceled dozens of sailings, and is moving one of its ships, the Sapphire Princess, from Shanghai to Australia.
Shares in Princess Cruises' parent company Carnival Corporation are down nearly 16% for the year.
Carnival said last week that the hit to global bookings and canceled voyages ""will have a material impact"" on its finances.
Carnival runs its flagship Carnival Cruise Line, the Princess Cruises brand and the Holland America Line, whose fleet includes the Westerdam, a ship that has been linked to one confirmed case of the coronavirus.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new travel advisory today for Hong Kong due to the coronavirus outbreak.
This is the only coronavirus-related travel advisory the agency has issued outside of mainland China.
The CDC advises travelers to “practice usual precautions,” in accordance with a “Watch - Level 1” notice of three possible levels.These precautions include avoiding contact with sick people and cleaning hands.
The agency also advises people to seek medical advice if they have spent time in Hong Kong during the last two weeks and feel ill with fever or respiratory symptoms.
The agency currently lists mainland China as “Warning - Level 3” and advises travelers to “avoid nonessential travel.” The notice excludes Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
Scientists around the world are slamming and debunking conspiracy theories that the novel coronavirus has its origins not in animals, but in a Chinese laboratory, according to a statement published today in the medical journal The Lancet.
""We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” wrote the 27 authors, citing studies from scientists in multiple countries that have analyzed the virus’ genetic makeup.
These studies ""overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens.” What this is about: CNN previously reported statements by Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas this week on Fox News saying that “this virus did not originate in the Wuhan animal market” and implying that it may have started in a laboratory not far away.
""We don't have evidence that this disease originated there ...

19,"The Hubei health authority in China reported that 115 more people died of the coronavirus in Hubei province on Thursday, raising the death toll in the epicenter since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak to 2,144.
Hubei authorities confirmed an additional 411 cases of the virus in Hubei on Thursday.
The total number of cases in the epicenter of the outbreak is now 62,442.
By the numbers: The Hubei report brings the total number of deaths in mainland China to at least 2,233.
The global death toll is at least 2,244, with 11 deaths outside of mainland China.
Japan has reported three deaths from the coronavirus, while Hong Kong and Iran have each reported two deaths from coronavirus.
The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases now exceeds 76,154 with the vast majority of cases in mainland China.
China’s National Health Commission is expected to release numbers for all of China’s provinces later today.
Two passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Australia.
Brendan Murphy, chief medical officer for the Australian government, said in a statement that 164 people from the Diamond Princess arrived to the Howard Springs Quarantine Facility on Thursday to begin their 14-day quarantine.
Upon arrival, six passengers were identified to have minor respiratory symptoms and/or fevers.
The six symptomatic passengers were moved into isolation and tested, two of those people have since tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
Murphy said both patients ""remain well"" and are being housed in a special isolation unit at the quarantine facility.
Murphy added that ""the development of positive cases after return to Australia is not unexpected"" since there was continued evidence of spread of infection on board the Diamond Princess.
Murphy reassured other passengers and the crew on the Qantas evacuation flight saying that ""all measures were taken to ensure their protection"" and that ""the small number of passengers on the plane meant passengers could be spread out higher risk passengers were seated in separate sections."" The Department of Health reiterated that the two new cases pose no risk to the Howard Spring community and the surrounding communities around the quarantine facility.
Australia now has 17 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus.
Kuwait Airways suspended all flights to Iran on Thursday until further notice and advised its citizens not to travel to Qom following the emergence of coronavirus cases in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kuwait Airways and state news said in a statement.
Kuwaiti Health Ministry said in a statement that it is advising citizens not to travel to the Iranian city of Qom. Those returning from Qom will be put into 14-day quarantine to ensure they do not carry the virus.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) the total global lost revenue for airlines could be $29.3 billion due to coronavirus.
IATA announced that its initial assessment of the impact of the novel coronavirus 2019 outbreak — also known as COVID-19 — shows a potential 13% full-year loss of passenger demand for carriers in the Asia-Pacific region.
“The sharp downturn in demand as a result of COVID-19 will have a financial impact on airlines — severe for those particularly exposed to the China market,” said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s director general and CEO.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new travel advisory today for Japan due to the coronavirus outbreak — the second coronavirus-related travel advisory the agency has issued outside of mainland China.
The CDC advises travelers to “practice usual precautions,” in accordance with a “Watch - Level 1” notice out of three possible levels.
Yesterday, the agency listed the first travel notice outside of mainland China — for Hong Kong, which also carries the “Level 1” advisory.
The agency also advises people to seek medical advice if they have spent time in Japan during the last two weeks and feel ill with fever or respiratory symptoms.
The agency currently lists mainland China as “Warning - Level 3” and advises travelers to “avoid nonessential travel.” The notice excludes Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
Chinese officials say the government has taken prudent action in the handling of the novel coronavirus.
China's State Council Information Office held a news conference today to lay out this case.
Yu Xiangyang, the deputy secretary general of State Council, said the city of Wuhan was put under travel restrictions and the Lunar New Year holiday was extended after President Xi Jinping instructed a senior adviser to ""supervise efforts to contain the novel coronavirus."" Yu also said the government mobilized resources and imports after finding daily demand was 15,000 protective suits a day when the supply was only 10,000 suits a day.
Yu said there were not enough hospital beds at first but it was not acceptable to turn suspected cases away.
He said the government established an ""accountability mechanism"" to ensure that ""officials and governments at all levels are held accountable in a city and a province"".
In a bid to ensure accountability, Yu said, ""We will exercise maximum penalty to all those not doing their job well while working on prevention and control of the epidemic” and said the government was conducting “undercover investigations in communities.” Yu went on to say all reported missed cases covered in the media have been investigated by Xi’s adviser, Sun Chunlan, and that all patients involved have been treated.
US health experts are part of a World Health Organization team in China investigating the novel coronavirus outbreak, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday during a press briefing.
Tedros said the team on the ground in China includes experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US National Institutes of Health, as well as experts from Singapore, Korea, Japan, Nigeria, Germany and Russia.
The team includes experts in epidemiology, virology, clinical management, outbreak control and public health, he said.
Team members are working with Chinese counterparts to study transmissibility of the virus and the impact the of measures taken in China, Tedros said.
US health officials have said they made repeated offers, starting in early January, to send health experts to China, and expressed frustration that US experts had not yet been invited in.
A plane carrying Ukrainian citizens and other nationals evacuated from Wuhan, China, arrived today at Kharkiv Airport in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian Ministry of Interior said in a statement.
The statement said border guards provided clearance for 94 people arriving on the special flight: 22 crew members and accompanying medical personnel, along with 72 passengers.
The ministry said the passengers included 45 Ukrainian citizens and 27 citizens of other countries, including Argentina, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Montenegro, Panama and Israel.
Video released by the ministry showed border control inspectors carrying out their inspections in full protective gear.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky defended the move, describing security measures on the flight as “unprecedented.” Passengers on board the aircraft, he added, were all healthy but would be quarantined and monitored over a period of 14 days at a medical facility belonging to the Ukrainian National Guard in the town of Novi Sanzhary.
In a Facebook post, Zelensky called on citizens to stop “attempts to block routes, block hospitals, not allow Ukrainian citizens into Ukraine.""

20,"Our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak has moved here.
Fifty-nine Hong Kong police officers will be quarantined after a 40-year-old male officer tested positive for novel coronavirus on Thursday, according to a statement released by Hong Kong police.
There are 34 people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the United States, according to an announcement Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
This includes 21 cases among repatriated individuals, as well as 13 US cases.
""We are keeping track of cases resulting from repatriation efforts separately because we don't believe those numbers accurately represent the picture of what is happening in the community in the United States at this time,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters Friday.
About the cases: The 21 repatriated include 18 former passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked in Japan, plus three who had been previously evacuated from China.
There are 10 additional passengers among the Diamond Princess evacuees who tested positive for the virus in Japan, and who Messonnier said will likely be added to the official US count once the Japanese test results have been adjudicated.
The 13 US cases include seven in California, one in Massachusetts, one in Washington state, one in Arizona, two in Illinois and one in Wisconsin.
Among these cases, there are two instances of person-to-person transmission, one in Illinois and one in California.
The 13th US case was confirmed overnight in Humboldt County, California.
County officials offered few details but said a close contact with symptoms was also undergoing testing, and both are self-isolating at home.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now track confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the United States in two separate and distinct groups: those repatriated by the US Department of State and those identified by the US public health network.
What this means: By these new metrics, there are now 21 confirmed cases among repatriated Americans and 13 confirmed cases among Americans first identified on US soil, said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease.
Eighteen cases have been confirmed among passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship now back in the United States.
Three cases have been confirmed among passengers from the Wuhan repatriation flights now back in the United States.
Up until yesterday, the CDC was reporting 15 confirmed cases in the United States.
The reason that number has dropped to 13 is because two cases have moved into the case count of repatriated individuals.
Today, 253 people who tested negative for coronavirus after 14 days of quarantine disembarked from Diamond Princess cruise ship, according to the press release from the Japanese Ministry of Health.
The disembarkation of passengers from the ship will continue at least through Saturday, a spokesperson for Princess Cruises told CNN.
Nine new cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed in Japan, bringing the countrywide total to 726, according to the press release by the Japan Ministry of Health.
The total number of confirmed cases from the Diamond Princess cruise ship stands at 639 and the number of land-based cases in Japan stands at 87.
China has changed how it counts coronavirus cases in Hubei province three times now — but a World Health Organization official told reporters during a media briefing on Friday that is normal during an active outbreak.
“As long as we understand how things are counted and what the numbers include then it helps us to make the best possible decision to protect the health of people.” Last week, China announced it would count “clinically diagnosed” cases in its tally for Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak.
Then yesterday, the government changed its approach and “clinically confirmed” were excluded from the tally of confirmed cases.
There’s great concern about the spread of the novel coronavirus in countries outside China and among people with no connection to China or Wuhan, World Health Orginization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Friday.
There’s still a window of opportunity to contain the virus, Tedros said, “but the window of opportunity is narrowing.” WHO is calling on countries to continue containment measures while preparing for community transmission, he said.
He said China’s containment measures in Wuhan and elsewhere are “hammering” the virus and can help contain it.
The outbreak can still go any direction, Tedros said, and countries need to prepare for any eventuality.
Dr. Sylvie Briand, director of the World Health Organization's Infectious Hazards Management Department, said the agency is working to prepare countries’ health care workers with training and making sure they know how to protect themselves, and to make sure countries have enough workers to handle a number of cases.
The World Health Organization-led joint mission working on coronavirus in China will travel tomorrow to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said today during a press briefing.
It’s up to the team what it wants to focus on there, Tedros said.

Israel expanded its restrictions on the entry of foreign nationals to include anyone who has been in South Korea and Japan in the last 14 days, the Health Ministry announced Saturday afternoon.
A Korean Air flight from South Korea landed at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport Saturday evening.
Only 12 Israelis were allowed off the plane and were immediately taken to their homes, the ministry said.
Approximately 200 foreign nationals were not allowed off the plane.
Last week, Israel announced that any foreign national who had been in Thailand, Singapore, Macau, or Hong Kong in the previous 14 days would be denied entry.
Israel has already barred foreigners who have recently traveled through China from entering the country.
Earlier Saturday, the Health Ministry warned that nine South Korean tourists who had been part of a tour group in Israel were diagnosed with coronavirus upon returning to South Korea.
Anyone who came into close contact with the tourists for an extended period of time was instructed to self-quarantine.
Already, 20 workers of Israel's Natural Parks Authority who encountered the tour group will self-quarantine until at least Wednesday, the ministry said.
A class of 30 students and two teachers who came into contact with the tour group will self-quarantine until Thursday.
Another teacher is already being tested at Soroka hospital in Tel Aviv.
Late Saturday, the ministry announced that another group of 60 students and 6 adults, including teachers and security guards, would self-quarantine, after coming into contact with the South Korean tourists.
None of this latest group is showing any symptoms or coronavirus, the ministry said.
The number of people currently infected with novel coronavirus in Italy has risen to 62, with 46 cases in the northern region of Lombardy, 12 cases in the region of Veneto, three cases in Rome and one case in the Piedmont region.
Alberto Cirio, governor of the Piedmont region, announced the latest case on Twitter.
The first death was a 78-year-old man from Veneto region who died at a hospital in Padua on Friday, according to Italian news agency ANSA.
During a press conference on Saturday, the head of the Lombardy health department, Giulio Gallera, said the second patient to die of coronavirus in Italy was a 77-year-old woman in Lombardy.
���We still have to investigate the relation between the death and the virus,” Gallera added.
According to the website of the Lombardy region, train stations of the three villages mostly affected by the coronavirus – Codogno, Maleo, Casalpusterlengo – will be closed from Saturday, with trains no longer stopping there.
Three previous cases from Rome – one Italian and two Chinese tourists – have now recovered.
The US State Department raised the travel alert for Americans to Level 2 on Saturday for travel to South Korea due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to a release from the department.
The total number of confirmed cases in Italy has risen to 55, a spike that is attributed to a rise in cases in the country's north.
This includes 39 confirmed cases in the northern region of Lombardy and 12 in the Veneto region, the head of the Lombardy health department, Giulio Gallera, said at a press conference Saturday.
A 77-year-old female patient with coronavirus was found dead in her Lombardy home, he confirmed.
“We can say she is the second victim of coronavirus in Italy,” Gallera said.
But he added that authorities still had to ""investigate the relation between the death and the virus."" Infections spike: In Lombardy, 35 people tested positive in the town of Codogno, two in the city of Cremona, and two near the city of Pavia, Gallera added.
All public activities have also been suspended in 10 villages south of Milan, Gallera added.
According to the Lombardy region website, train stations in three places affected by the outbreak -- Codogno, Maleo, Casalpusterlengo -- will be closed from Saturday.
“All the people (who) tested positive have been in contact, directly or indirectly with the hospital of Codogno,” the governor of Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, said.
“All the people (who) tested positive have been in contact, directly or indirectly with the hospital of Codogno,” the governor of Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, said.
Gallera said “patient one” was a 38-year-old man at Codogno hospital, who did not travel to China but met a friend who had.
Gallera said “patient one” was a 38-year-old man at Codogno hospital, who did not travel to China but met a friend who had.
Authorities have been testing colleagues, heath workers, and other people who had close contact with the first patient.
The Japanese Ministry of Health has discovered that 23 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship were released after their quarantine without being retested, a condition of their release.
“I (feel deep) remorse that an operational mistake invited such a situation and we would like to make sure that such a situation will never occur again,” health minister Katsunobu Kato said during a press conference Saturday.
The ministry also confirmed that one of the ship’s passengers, a woman in her 60s from Tochigi Prefecture in Japan, tested positive for coronavirus after disembarking the Diamond Princess on February 19.
She was among the 443 passengers cleared to leave the ship on the first day of disembarkation after a 14-day quarantine.
She is the first known case of infection after the end of the passenger quarantine period.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN he thinks ""we are clearly at the brink"" of a coronavirus pandemic.
In an interview with CNN's Michael Smerconish on Saturday, the nation's top infectious disease doctor said: ""Our fate is going to be determined by the ability of countries outside of China that have travel-related cases.
And it's going to be very difficult to prevent more cases from coming here to our own country."" Fauci said, however, that the risk to the US is still ""very low,"" but warned that could ""change rapidly."" He also said evacuating Americans off the Diamond Princess cruise ship was a ""difficult decision,"" but he believed it was ""without a doubt the correct decision."" In a strong statement, Israel's health ministry warned that nine South Korean tourists who visited the country recently have tested positive for coronavirus upon returning home.
The ministry called on anyone who may have come into close contact with the tour group for an extended period of time to self-quarantine.
The tourists visited some of the most popular sites in Israel and the West Bank from February 8 to 16, increasing the chance of a large-scale exposure in the region, the ministry said Saturday.
Providing a list of dates and locations, the ministry warned that anyone who came within two meters of the group for more than 15 minutes should self-quarantine for 14 days.
The group visited Masada in southern Israel, the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.
The potential for a large-scale exposure appears to be high given the number of tourists who regularly visit these sites and others.
The release of the statement on a Saturday is an indication of how seriously authorities are taking the threat of coronavirus spreading in Israel.
Government statements are rarely released on Saturday in Israel since it is the Sabbath.
This comes after Israel announced its first case of the coronavirus on Friday.
The victim is an Israeli woman who returned from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan.
She was one of 11 passengers flown back from the Diamond Princess.
All of the passengers remain quarantined in hospital.",2020-02-22,"['health', 'report', 'people', 'death', 'toll', 'case', 'virus', 'case', 'prison', 'number', 'case', 'condition', 'health', 'report', 'number', 'death', 'mainland', 'report', 'death', 'report', 'death', 'report', 'death', 'number', 'case', 'case', 'mainland', 'health', 'release', 'number', 'today', 'flight', 'passenger', 'people', 'news', 'affairs', 'health', 'administration', 'aviation', 'today', 'number', 'flight', 'passenger', 'city', 'page', 'flight', 'passenger', 'report', 'case', 'report', 'country', 'health', 'report', 'state', 'news', 'country', 'case', 'restriction', 'entry', 'day', 'health', 'afternoon', 'air', 'flight', 'land', 'gurion', 'evening', 'plane', 'home', 'plane', 'week', 'day', 'entry', 'bar', 'travel', 'country', 'health', 'tourist', 'part', 'tour', 'group', 'return', 'contact', 'tourist', 'period', 'time', 'self', 'worker', 'parks', 'encounter', 'tour', 'group', 'self', 'class', 'student', 'teacher', 'contact', 'tour', 'group', 'self', 'teacher', 'test', 'hospital', 'group', 'student', 'adult', 'teacher', 'security', 'self', 'contact', 'tourist', 'none', 'group', 'symptom', 'number', 'people', 'case', 'region', 'case', 'region', 'case', 'case', 'region', 'cirio', 'region', 'case', 'death', 'man', 'region', 'hospital', 'news', 'press', 'conference', 'head', 'health', 'woman', 'relation', 'death', 'virus', 'website', 'region', 'train', 'station', 'village', 'train', 'case', 'tourist', 'state', 'travel', 'level', 'travel', 'release', 'number', 'case', 'case', 'country', 'case', 'region', 'region', 'head', 'health', 'press', 'conference', 'home', 'victim', 'relation', 'death', 'virus', 'infection', 'people', 'test', 'town', 'city', 'city', 'activity', 'village', 'region', 'website', 'train', 'station', 'place', 'people', 'test', 'contact', 'hospital', 'region', 'people', 'test', 'contact', 'hospital', 'region', 'man', 'hospital', 'travel', 'friend', 'man', 'hospital', 'travel', 'friend', 'test', 'worker', 'people', 'contact', 'health', 'passenger', 'cruise', 'ship', 'release', 'reteste', 'condition', 'release', 'remorse', 'mistake', 'situation', 'situation', 'health', 'press', 'conference', 'ship', 'passenger', 'woman', 'prefecture', 'test', 'passenger', 'ship', 'day', 'disembarkation', 'case', 'infection', 'end', 'passenger', 'period', 'director', 'diseases', 'nation', 'doctor', 'fate', 'ability', 'country', 'travel', 'case', 'case', 'country', 'risk', 'change', 'cruise', 'ship', 'decision', 'doubt', 'decision', 'statement', 'health', 'tourist', 'country', 'test', 'return', 'home', 'call', 'contact', 'tour', 'group', 'period', 'time', 'self', 'tourist', 'site', 'bank', 'increase', 'chance', 'scale', 'exposure', 'region', 'list', 'date', 'location', 'meter', 'group', 'minute', 'self', 'day', 'group', 'patriarchs', 'church', 'scale', 'exposure', 'number', 'tourist', 'site', 'release', 'statement', 'indication', 'threat', 'government', 'statement', 'release', 'case', 'victim', 'woman', 'return', 'cruise', 'ship', 'passenger', 'passenger', 'hospital']"

The case involves a woman who arrived in Canada from China on Friday, the Ontario Ministry of Health said in a news release.
She had an ""intermittent cough that was improving,"" the news release said, but she went to the emergency department at North York General Hospital in Toronto at the advice of Telehealth Ontario.
Laboratory testing indicated the patient was ""presumptive positive"" for the coronavirus, the news release said.
Officials are awaiting final confirmation from the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg.
The patient was discharged and is in self-isolation, the news release said.
Officials said there was a low risk that the patient was infectious, and she's had limited exposure to other people since she arrived in Canada.
Provincial officials are working to contact airplane passengers who might have been in close proximity to the patient.
Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health said: Canada had nine confirmed cases of coronavirus as of Friday, according to the country's Public Health Agency.
Turkey and Afghanistan will close their borders with Iran due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Turkish and Afghan governments said Sunday.
Turkey has also ""temporarily halted"" flights arriving from Iran, Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said, according to state-news agency Anadolu.
Afghanistan closed its border with Iran after it announced it was testing three people suspected of having coronavirus.
The three people had recently returned from Iran.
“To avoid spreading of coronavirus the government of Afghanistan has stopped any contact with Iran via land or air.
The borders are closed,” the Afghani National Security website said.
Iran’s Health Ministry confirmed on Sunday that eight people have died from the novel coronavirus and 43 have so far been infected in the country.
Current global economic growth remains slow with the coronavirus outbreak posing the greatest risk, finance ministers and central bankers meeting at the G20 summit in Saudi Arabia said in a statement.
Despite that outlook, the G20 said that global economic growth is expected to pick up ""modestly"" in 2020 and 2021.
The host of the G20 meeting, Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed Al Jadaan, said that countries will be ready to act on the risk coronavirus poses to commerce.
""We all agreed that all countries and states will be ready to intervene as needed to face these risks and it’ll be a multilateral intervention including the WHO (World Health Organization) to monitor these risks and use relevant policies as needed,"" Jadaan said.
Israel's ministry of health has announced the country's second case of coronavirus.
A man who was a passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, who returned to Israel last week, tested positive for the disease.
The first case of coronavirus was announced on Friday.
A woman who had also returned from the Diamond Princess tested positive following a check in Israel.
In addition, the number of Israeli citizens instructed to place themselves under self-quarantine has jumped to more than 700, Ministry of Health Director-General Moshe Bar Siman Tov told Channel 12 News.
More than 300 of those came into close contact with a group of visiting South Korean tourists who tested positive for the disease upon returning home, Siman Tov said.
Another 400 Israeli citizens who have returned from East Asian countries where coronavirus is spreading have also been told to remain home and avoid public spaces for 14 days, in accordance with Ministry of Health instructions.
As of Sunday evening, the Ministry said 18 members of the South Korean tour group tested positive for coronavirus upon returning to their home country.
By the numbers: In a precautionary move, Israel barred foreign nationals from participating in the upcoming Tel Aviv marathon, scheduled for this Friday.
Amid reports of multiple diagnoses of the move coranavirus in Italy, the US military in Italy is closing schools and taking other precautionary steps.
Vogel added: ""As of 4 p.m., Feb. 23, there are zero confirmed cases within the city of Vicenza, the Vicenza Military Community, Darby Military Community, or Ghedi Military Community.

White House officials are expected to ask Congress for emergency funding this week to battle the coronavirus amid growing fears of a larger outbreak in the US, two officials familiar with the forthcoming request said.
Government aides worked throughout the weekend on the supplemental request, which is still not final but could be sent to Capitol Hill as soon as Monday,  said a person familiar with the plans.
That source said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has ruffled feathers through the process by requesting amounts of money that “have been seen as largely out of proportion.” The source noted HHS already has money that could be used for coronavirus issues, but claimed Azar “has been pushing hard for this to overcompensate” for management decisions regarding coronavirus containment that the source criticized.
By the numbers: The US now has 36 confirmed cases of coronavirus.
Fourteen Americans who tested positive for the disease returned to the US this week after spending weeks in isolation on the luxury cruise ship Diamond Princess docked in Japan.
The supplemental funding request was first reported by Politico.

23,"The White House has requested $1.25 billion in emergency funding to address coronavirus, as well as the ability to tap an additional $535 million in emergency funds already appropriated.
The Trump administration expects “to allocate at least $2.5 billion in total resources” for the response effort.
Much of that would come from shifting already appropriated money from agency accounts.
The US Food and Drug Administration is currently not able to conduct routine inspections on drugs, medical supplies or household goods from China due the US State Department’s travel advisory for China over the coronavirus outbreak, the agency said in a statement.
Inspections are just one tool the FDA uses to make sure products are safe, and the lack of inspections is “not hindering our efforts to monitor medical products and food safety,” officials said.
The agency monitors products through import screening, sampling and import alerts and it works with US Customs and Border Protection to look for products that violate legal requirements.
Some 60% of FDA-regulated products imported from China are medical devices, the agency said, and 20% are housewares, such as food packaging.
In response to the outbreak, the FDA said it will also use, where appropriate, the agency’s authority to request records from firms “in advance or in lieu of” drug surveillance inspections in China.
Paper records will help prioritize what inspections should happen first during what could become a back log in on-the-ground inspections, depending on how long the travel restrictions continue, the agency said.
The FDA reiterated that there is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted through imported goods, but added that this is a “dynamic” situation and the agency will continue to assess it and update guidance as needed.
The FDA promised it is working around the clock to monitor and mitigate any coronavirus-related issues in a collaborative effort with other agencies.
The United States and South Korea are considering scaling back joint military exercises due to the coronavirus outbreak in the Korean peninsula.
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said military commanders in Korea “are looking at scaling back the command post training due to concerns about the coronavirus.” Esper said he is confident the US and South Korea will “remain fully ready to deal with any threats that we might face together.” Hong Kong and Taiwan reported new cases of novel coronavirus on Monday.
Hong Kong reported two new cases of novel coronavirus from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, bringing the total to 81 in the city, the Department of Health said in a statement late Monday.
Meanwhile in Taiwan, officials confirmed two new cases of the novel coronavirus, bringing the island's total to 30, the Central Epidemic Command Center announced at a news conference Monday.
Officials in San Antonio, Texas, are reporting they have six patients with confirmed cases of novel coronavirus.
One of the patients is from the group of Wuhan evacuees and five patients are from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
The patients with the coronavirus are in isolation at the Texas Center for Infectious Disease.
Nirenberg said he was proud that San Antonio stepped up to help the nation during this “challenge.” “[L]et’s be clear, the most dangerous, damaging infectious disease is hysteria and so what we’re trying to do is make sure we have a compassionate human response to a crisis that’s happening,” the mayor said.
Dr. Nancy Knight, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's division of global health protection, said lab results are still pending.
“Given the high risk environment that the Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers came from, I would not be surprised if we have additional cases,” Knight said.
A man who tested positive for the novel coronavirus and was evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship is being transferred to the University of Nebraska Medical Center from Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, according to a hospital statement.
The hospital is monitoring 14 people, of which 12 have tested positive for coronavirus.

Air Canada is extending its suspension of flights between Canada and Beijing and Shanghai until April 10, and daily non-stop flights from Toronto to Hong Kong until April 30, according to the airline.
However, Air Canada will continue to operate its non-stop flights from Vancouver to Hong Kong, which will accommodate customers originally booked on its Toronto-Hong Kong flights, the airline said.
Some background: The airline initially suspended services to Beijing and Shanghai in February after the Canadian government discouraged non-essential travel to China.
Watch: While the US Food and Drug is not aware of any shortages of medical products being reported in the United States, it is monitoring some that could be at risk, FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn told reporters Tuesday.
In particular, the FDA is keeping its eye on personal protective equipment such as face masks and gowns used by health care workers.
The agency is proactively reaching out to hundreds of manufacturers of medical products for information related to these concerns, Hahn said.
More on this: US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said some of the $2.5 billion requested funds would be used to purchase personal protection equipment for the national stockpile.
On Tuesday morning, Azar told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee there are 30 million N95 respirators in the Strategic National Stockpile, and the US would need about 10 times that for health care workers.
Hahn also said that the agency is postponing roughly 100 scheduled inspections in China over February and March — mostly routine surveillance inspections meant to ensure that medical products produced in China meet the standards for entering the US marketplace.
But he said these can happen at any time during the year, and the agency is moving things around so they can stay on schedule when it comes to planned inspections for the year.

“We find ourselves in a situation that requires a quicker local response,” the association wrote.
While the CDC currently has no backlog or delay in testing, the lab association’s CEO, Scott Becker, told CNN that its concern is not about the current situation, but for when community spread of the virus increases.
“We want to encourage and ensure that we have the test closest to the population,” Becker said.
The CDC announced on Feb. 6 that 200 test kits would be distributed to labs across the United States.
The kits needed to be verified by the local health laboratories to ensure they were working.
Less than a week later, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said some labs that had received the tests were getting inconclusive results, and components of the tests would need to be remade.
The CDC has been working to resolve the testing kit issue but has yet to provide a timeline about when labs will receive new tests.
A 70-year-old man is the first person to test positive for coronavirus in Switzerland, the country’s Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) told CNN.
The Swiss man from the canton of Ticino, a region which borders Italy, had been to Lombardy, Italy, in mid-February.
He has been hospitalized, where he's “under isolation and in good health so far,"" a FOPH spokesperson said.
Italy is the site of Europe's biggest coronavirus outbreak.

25,"Our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak has moved here.
There are “ongoing” conversations at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about expanding airport health screenings for the novel coronavirus given the rapid spread of the infection in Italy, South Korea and Japan, according to an agency spokesperson.
Currently, the United States is doing health screenings only for passengers who are flying in from China.
At the time that the CDC made the decision to start those screenings, there were far fewer cases of the coronavirus in China as there are currently in Japan, Italy or South Korea.
When the screening started on January 17, there were 45 cases of the new coronavirus in China.
Japan currently has about three times that number of cases, Italy has about 10 times as many and South Korea has more than 25 times as many.
Asked if he was worried about the spread of novel coronavirus in the United States, President Trump said, “No, because we’re ready for it."" “It is what it is.
We’re really prepared,"" the President continued.
""We have, as I said, we have the greatest people in the world.
We’re very ready for it.
We’re very ready for it.
We hope it doesn’t spread.
There’s a chance that it won’t spread, too.
And there’s a chance that it will.
When you have 15 people — with this whole world coming into the United States — and the 15 people are either better or close to being better, that’s pretty good.” There are now 60 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The current total breaks down to 42 passengers who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, three people repatriated from China and 15 US cases.
President Trump urged Americans to take the same precautions for coronavirus that they would during a normal flu season.
You don't have to necessarily grab every handrail, unless you have to,"" Trump said.
Trump added that he tries to ""bail out as much as possible"" when he's around anyone showing cold or flu symptoms.
The US has ordered ""a lot"" of masks to deal with a potential coronavirus outbreak, President Trump said.
""We're looking at worst-case scenario, we're going to be set very quickly."" Trump insisted he didn't think the US would end up needing the masks because flights and ""borders are very controlled."" President Trump was just asked if he's considering imposing travel restrictions to and from more countries with coronavirus outbreaks, such as Italy and South Korea.
He added that eventually there could be a ""right time."" US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said coronavirus poses a low risk to the American public.
“The immediate risk to the American public is and continues to be low,” Azar said at a White House press briefing.
Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director for the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, said the US should expect to see more cases of coronavirus.
Schuchat urged Americans to prepare for the virus as well as schools and businesses.
""Tt's the perfect time for businesses, health care systems, universities, and schools to look at their pandemic preparedness plans, dust them off, and make sure that they're ready,"" she said.
She said the future is uncertain, but assured the public that steps have been taken to prepare for such outbreaks.
""So, this — the trajectory of what we're looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain.
But many of the steps that we have taken over the past 15 years to prepare for pandemic influenza and our experience  going through the 2009 H1N1 pandemic of influenza remind us of the kinds of steps our health care system, our businesses, our communities and schools may need to take,"" Schuchat said.
President Trump said the Americans who have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus are doing “very well.” Trump said he had just been briefed by members of his administration.
“Of the 15 people … eight of them have returned to their homes, to stay at their homes until they’re fully recovered.
And five have fully recovered.
And one we think is in pretty good shape,” Trump said at the White House.
“In almost all cases, they’re getting better,"" Trump said.
He added that there are also patients who were brought back to the US from Japan.
""We took in some from Japan … because they’re American citizens.
They’re in quarantine and they’re getting better, too,” Trump said, adding that they were repatriated because “we felt that we had an obligation to do that.” “We could have left them and that would have been very bad, very bad,” he said.

President Trump expressed optimism Thursday that Coronavirus would eventually be contained and eliminated in the US, even as he acknowledged it could get worse first.
Trump called his Wednesday appearance before the White House press corps “a really good press conference.” “One of the advantages is that I get covered live,” he added.
“It was a calming press conference.” He also claimed the media won’t give the administration “credit” for a successful response to the coronavirus.
The President also said that the federal government was busy preparing for the coronavirus while Democrats were working on impeachment.
Because we were hearing about it,” he said.
Dr. Thomas Frieden, the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer today that he couldn’t comment on a whistleblower in the Department of Health and Human Services who contends HHS workers handled coronavirus evacuees from Wuhan, China, without the proper protective gear until he reads the complaint.
Instead, Frieden stressed what other top health officials have been saying for the past week, that the virus is going to spread in the US.
He said the Trump administration’s request for $2.5 billion to fight the outbreak is key.

The Port of Los Angeles has canceled 40 vessel calls and estimated it has experienced a 25% drop in overall volumes this month, Port of Los Angeles spokesman Phillip Sanfield told CNN.
The Port of Los Angeles is one of the world’s busiest seaports and the leading gateway for international trade in the Western Hemisphere, according to the port’s website.
The cancellations, which cover scheduled vessel calls between February 11 and April 1, represent about 25% of the port’s normal vessel calls during the time frame, Sanfield said.
The 25% decrease in overall volumes this month compared to February of last year is “largely due to coronavirus,” Sanfield said.
He explained that trade war is a factor, but coronavirus is the main reason.
The port estimates an overall decrease for the first quarter of 2020 of about 15% compared to 2019, Sanfield added.

30,"The city of Kirkland, Washington, is putting two more firefighters in quarantine as a result of possible exposure to coronavirus.
That figure includes 19 firefighters who were moved into isolation, with some showing possible symptoms of coronavirus, according to Doug Stern, spokesman for the International Association of Fire Fighters.
An additional 10 firefighters are in quarantine from the nearby Redmond and Woodinville Fire Departments, along with two Kirkland police officers.
The death toll from the coronavirus has reached 28 in South Korea with 600 newly confirmed cases, raising the national tally to 4,812 cases, the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a news release Tuesday.
Among the additional cases, 519 are from Daegu city and 61 are from North Gyeongsang Province, which surrounds Daegu city.
Daegu city alone accounts for 74.8% of the overall national confirmed cases.
When combined, North Gyeongsang Province and Daegu city account for 89% of the national total of confirmed novel coronavirus cases, according to the KCDC.
The city of Redmond, Washington, declared a state of emergency due to the coronavirus, according to a news release from the city.
The state of emergency does not call for any immediate changes by the government or residents.
The city said the declaration is intended to make it easier to ask for additional resources to deal with coronavirus.
Redmond is best known as the worldwide headquarters of Microsoft and is only 4 miles from Kirkland, Washington, where six patients died after contracting coronavirus infections, and dozens of first responders are in quarantine.
Australia confirmed an additional case of coronavirus in Queensland Tuesday, bringing the country's total number of cases to 31, Queensland Health announced in a statement.

Twitter is asking all of its employees worldwide to stay away from their offices until further notice to avoid spreading the novel coronavirus, the company said in a message posted Monday on the its official blog.
The guidance is not mandatory for most employees, and Christie said Twitter’s offices will remain open.
The company will be deep cleaning its facilities to protect employees who feel they need to come to work.
Christie said they are taking steps “out of an abundance of caution and the utmost dedication to keeping our Tweeps healthy.” Employees based in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea are now required to work from home, due partially to government restrictions already in place in those countries.
Carnival Cruise Lines is changing some ship itineraries as some countries are not allowing ships to dock because of concerns over coronavirus.
Carnival said in a statement it is changing itineraries for ships scheduled to sail to Grand Cayman and Jamaica this week.
""A number of Caribbean destinations continue to work through their policies with regards to cruise ship visits.
And while we are following all US CDC and World Health Organization screening protocols and guidelines, we want to avoid any possibility of a visit to a destination where there is uncertainty or we risk being turned away,"" the cruise line said in a statement.
The city of San Antonio filed a lawsuit Monday against the federal government, including several agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services, to prevent further releases of individuals who have been quarantined at Lackland Air Force Base without the city’s input and demands.
The move follows the CDC’s release of a woman from quarantine at Lackland AFB, who later tested positive for the coronavirus.
As part of its efforts to protect its community from the outbreak, the city is also demanding that patients undergo three tests for coronavirus, instead of the current two, as part of the protocol to end their quarantine.
The lawsuit is also seeking a protocol that would be agreed between the city, the state of Texas and the CDC prior to releasing patients who are under quarantine.
City officials are also asking the court to maintain the status quo of the surgeon general’s exercise of quarantine authority.
The surgeon general, with the approval of the health and human services secretary, is legally authorized to make and enforce a quarantine if he deems it necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United States.
Australia will consider invoking the Biosecurity Act to detain its citizens suspected of carrying the coronavirus, Attorney General Christian Porter warned Monday.
In an interview with CNN affiliate Sky News Australia, Porter said there is a range of powers available that will allow the government to control people’s movements as it handles outbreaks such as the novel coronavirus.
He said detention may be an option for those who refuse to cooperate with health officials, including undergoing ""a brief decontamination"" or providing ""information on where they have been or who they have been in contact with.” The government will also consider declaring “human health zones” that will require everyone entering or leaving a certain area to be screened.",2020-03-02,"['city', 'result', 'exposure', 'figure', 'isolation', 'symptom', 'spokesman', 'fire', 'fighters', 'fire', 'departments', 'police', 'officer', 'death', 'toll', 'case', 'case', 'centers', 'news', 'release', 'case', 'city', 'city', 'city', 'account', 'case', 'city', 'account', 'case', 'city', 'state', 'emergency', 'news', 'release', 'city', 'state', 'emergency', 'call', 'change', 'government', 'resident', 'city', 'declaration', 'resource', 'deal', 'headquarters', 'mile', 'contract', 'infection', 'dozen', 'case', 'country', 'number', 'case', 'health', 'statement', 'man', 'travel', 'week', 'statement', 'employee', 'office', 'notice', 'company', 'message', 'guidance', 'employee', 'office', 'company', 'facility', 'employee', 'work', 'step', 'abundance', 'caution', 'dedication', 'employee', 'work', 'home', 'government', 'restriction', 'place', 'country', 'cruise', 'lines', 'change', 'ship', 'country', 'ship', 'dock', 'concern', 'statement', 'change', 'ship', 'schedule', 'week', 'number', 'work', 'policy', 'regard', 'cruise', 'ship', 'world', 'health', 'screening', 'possibility', 'uncertainty', 'risk', 'cruise', 'line', 'statement', 'city', 'file', 'government', 'centers', 'health', 'services', 'release', 'air', 'force', 'city', 'input', 'demand', 'release', 'woman', 'test', 'part', 'community', 'city', 'demand', 'test', 'part', 'end', 'city', 'state', 'release', 'city', 'court', 'surgeon', 'exercise', 'surgeon', 'approval', 'health', 'services', 'enforce', 'introduction', 'transmission', 'country', 'states', 'biosecurity', 'detain', 'citizen', 'attorney', 'porter', 'affiliate', 'sky', 'news', 'porter', 'range', 'power', 'government', 'people', 'movement', 'detention', 'option', 'health', 'decontamination', 'information', 'contact', 'government', 'health', 'area', 'screen']"

A senior administration official acknowledged that the Trump administration is feeling a major sense of urgency to distribute testing kits for the coronavirus amid bipartisan criticism that the kits are being deployed too slowly.
This official went on to note that roughly one million kits are expected to be distributed throughout the country in the coming days.
The official emphasized that the administration is eager for the kits to be deployed in order to obtain the data needed to assess just how widespread the outbreak is becoming, something that cannot be clearly determined at the moment.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that most events of the Arnold Sports Festival in Columbus, Ohio, will be held without spectators this weekend based on guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on preventing the spread of coronavirus.
The Arnold Sports Festival is an annual multi-sport festival held in Columbus that includes the Arnold Classic, a bodybuilding competition named for Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Schwarzenegger called the decision a ""very sad moment for us, for my partners Jim Lorimer and Bob Lorimer, because we have been doing this now since 1976 when we held the first Mr. Olympia and Mr. Universe competition in Columbus, Ohio, and ever since we have been doing this without any interruption whatsoever.” The former California governor added, “Let me be very clear that we have the biggest and the best health and fitness festival in the world, but we would never choose making money over people’s health.” The British Columbia Ministry of Health announced three additional confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Canadian province this evening.
This brings British Columbia's coronavirus total to 12, according to Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer.
According to Henry, the new cases include...
The three individuals did not require hospitalization and are recovering in their homes, according to Henry.
By the numbers: These new cases bring Canada’s total number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases to 33, including 20 in Ontario, 12 in British Columbia and one in Quebec.
Vice President Mike Pence pledged that upcoming briefings on coronavirus would be on camera, following a Tuesday evening on the record briefing led by Pence that the White House press office insisted remain off camera.
The press office also insisted that reporters not broadcast any sound from the briefing, in which the vice president announced several new US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiatives, including a change in policy that now allows any American to receive a coronavirus test, if a doctor deems it necessary.
When pressed about the briefing being off camera, Pence said it was because President Trump had already made multiple on camera statements today.
""You’re going to see us in here every day answering questions… but the president was at NIH today and the president addressed the country today,"" Pence said.
He added that “I expect we’ll be back on camera tomorrow.” Some context: On two occasions last week, Trump and members of the Coronavirus Task Force briefed reporters on camera from the briefing room.
Now that coronavirus is spreading in the US, lots of people are going to their doctors, urgent care clinics or emergency rooms to find out whether their coughs, sneezes and fevers mean they have the coronavirus.
But some are worried about the cost of that testing after the Miami Herald wrote a story about a man who went to the hospital with flu-like symptoms and was told he might owe $3,270.
(Turns out he actually had the flu, but his limited-coverage insurance policy left him with a $1,400 bill.) Here's how much it will cost you if you seek care: The coronavirus test itself shouldn’t generate a bill – for now – since the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is picking up the tab.
That could change as more labs start running the test.
But the visit and other tests aren’t free.
How much you’ll owe depends on several factors, including what insurance you have, where you seek treatment and what tests providers give you.
Going to the emergency room is typically far more pricey than visiting your doctor or an urgent care clinic.
Those feeling sick can call their insurers to learn what the costs they might incur.
State governments and the Trump administration are also looking to relieve the financial burden so Americans don’t hesitate to get checked out — which could worsen the disease’s spread.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday required health insurers in his state to waive any cost sharing associated with testing for coronavirus.
And the Trump administration is looking at providing hospitals with funding to care for the uninsured.",2020-03-03,"['employee', 'worker', 'email', 'staff', 'member', 'employee', 'work', 'time', 'company', 'contact', 'worker', 'downtown', 'office', 'company', 'email', 'authenticity', 'email', 'support', 'employee', 'case', 'state', 'report', 'case', 'country', 'health', 'statement', 'time', 'citizen', 'return', 'statement', 'hospital', 'level', 'care', 'self', 'isolation', 'home', 'country', 'case', 'month', 'citizen', 'travel', 'return', 'case', 'country', 'director', 'health', 'director', 'case', 'contact', 'contract', 'virus', 'condition', 'administration', 'administration', 'sense', 'urgency', 'testing', 'kit', 'criticism', 'kit', 'kit', 'country', 'day', 'administration', 'kit', 'order', 'moment', 'dewine', 'event', 'sports', 'weekend', 'guidance', 'centers', 'sports', 'competition', 'name', 'call', 'decision', 'moment', 'partner', 'lorimer', 'lorimer', 'competition', 'interruption', 'health', 'fitness', 'world', 'money', 'people', 'health', 'health', 'case', 'evening', 'health', 'officer', 'case', 'hospitalization', 'home', 'number', 'case', 'number', 'case', 'briefing', 'camera', 'evening', 'record', 'briefing', 'press', 'office', 'camera', 'press', 'office', 'reporter', 'broadcast', 'briefing', 'centers', 'change', 'policy', 'test', 'doctor', 'press', 'briefing', 'camera', 'camera', 'statement', 'today', 'day', 'answer', 'question', 'today', 'address', 'country', 'today', 'camera', 'tomorrow', 'context', 'occasion', 'week', 'member', 'task', 'force', 'reporter', 'camera', 'briefing', 'room', 'lot', 'people', 'doctor', 'care', 'emergency', 'room', 'cough', 'cost', 'testing', 'story', 'man', 'hospital', 'flu', 'symptom', 'flu', 'insurance', 'policy', 'cost', 'care', 'test', 'generate', 'centers', 'change', 'lab', 'test', 'test', 'factor', 'insurance', 'treatment', 'test', 'provider', 'emergency', 'room', 'doctor', 'care', 'call', 'cost', 'state', 'government', 'administration', 'health', 'state', 'cost', 'share', 'associate', 'testing', 'administration', 'hospital', 'funding', 'care']"

There are 11 passengers and 10 crew members on the Grand Princess cruise ship that are “symptomatic,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a press conference today.
The ship, which is currently off the coast, is holding hundreds of passengers, Newsom said.
The ship, which departed from San Francisco to Mexico from February 10-21, returned to San Francisco and left for Hawaii on February 21.
Over 50% of the 2,500 passengers from the cruise to Mexico are Californians, Newsom said.
Some of these passengers stayed and went on the second cruise to Hawaii on the same ship.
They are sharing the list of passengers with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health care partners to contact all individuals who were on the cruise ship.
The Senate is scheduled to vote on coronavirus funding at 1:45 p.m. ET tomorrow.
The House passed the $8.3 billion coronavirus response package this afternoon in an effort to send billions of dollars to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.
The vote was 415 to 2 with just two Republicans voting against the measure; Andy Biggs, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, and Ken Buck.
The legislation was formally unveiled this afternoon after lawmakers worked to hammer out a package to respond to the outbreak.
The funding package is far higher than the $2.5 billion the White House requested.
Despite that, however, the White House is expected to back the deal.
A coronavirus vaccine won’t be widely available for a long time, several top pharmaceutical executives said Wednesday.
Early stage clinical trials likely won’t start until the end of the year or in 2021, they said, cautioning that vaccines for previous viral outbreaks, such as SARS and Zika, never made it “over the finish line.” “So that's why we are cautioning people not to overpromise on the timeline of the vaccine availability,” she said, adding that preventing the future spread of coronavirus will take “more than a year and potentially longer than that,"" Gerberding said.
President Trump is pushing drug makers to develop vaccines swiftly, asking pharmaceutical executives on Monday if it could ready in the next few months.
His comments came days after Dr. Tony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a vaccine would hopefully be ready if the virus returns next year.
Johnson & Johnson will likely start phase one trials by the end of this year and begin larger-scale trials next year, said Paul Stoffels, the drug maker’s chief scientific officer.
Some outbreaks, such as Zika, disappear while vaccines are still in the clinical trial stage, Stoffels said.
Big money: Drug makers will likely get federal funding to help develop coronavirus vaccines, testing and treatment.
The House of Representative on Wednesday passed a $7.8 billion spending package that includes more than $3 billion for such efforts.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
The proclamation is to help advance resources to help California prepare for a broader spread of the virus.
Newsom said during today’s press conference that the proclamation “is not about money, it’s about resourcefulness.” “Money is not the issue,” Newsom added.
It will also help jurisdiction share information and data, advantageous to address the spread, Newsom said.

The Italian Cabinet is discussing a draft proposal that could put people in the region of Lombardy and 11 other provinces in northern Italy under complete lockdown due to coronavirus, according to a close adviser to one of the ministers attending a Cabinet meeting.
The text of the draft proposal – also sent to CNN by the press office of the Lombardy regional authority – says that people in Lombardy and the other 11 provinces should ""absolutely avoid any movement into and out ...
except for travel motivated by unavoidable working needs or situations of emergency."" The draft says the police, the fire brigade and armed forces could be used to enforce these measures.
It's unclear when or if these measure would actually be implemented, because the proposal is still being discussed and the terms could change.

The father of a woman with a presumptive positive case of coronavirus attended a school function with another child Saturday against the orders of health officials to isolate, St. Louis County Executive Sam Page said during a Sunday press conference.
The presumptive positive case in St. Louis County was identified as a woman in her 20s who had recently returned from Italy, a press release issued Saturday said.
The only reported case in the state, the woman had fever and respiratory issues, Gov. Mike Parson said.
The woman's father and other family members had been in daily contact multiple times a day since March 5 and knew they were supposed to isolate at home, Page said.
Health officials have since spoken to the father and told him he needs to stay home.
They will obtain a court order for quarantine if necessary, Page said.
Page did not know how many people attended the school function or what the possibility for exposure was.
The father and other members of the family are not exhibiting symptoms, he said.",2020-03-07,"['staff', 'hospital', 'self', 'member', 'staff', 'contact', 'person', 'action', 'conference', 'test', 'period', 'time', 'hand', 'time', 'contact', 'office', 'week', 'abundance', 'caution', 'case', 'press', 'release', 'state', 'health', 'case', 'state', 'case', 'case', 'release', 'case', 'connection', 'release', 'people', 'source', 'infection', 'release', 'tournament', 'people', 'concern', 'tournament', 'tournament', 'website', 'university', 'medicine', 'engineering', 'tournament', 'interest', 'fan', 'player', 'neighboring', 'area', 'tournament', 'community', 'tournament', 'director', 'tournament', 'date', 'option', 'case', 'press', 'release', 'health', 'woman', 'age', 'release', 'associate', 'cruise', 'travel', 'release', 'woman', 'health', 'release', 'case', 'city', 'case', 'state', 'case', 'health', 'services', 'press', 'release', 'man', 'isolation', 'home', 'release', 'history', 'travel', 'health', 'staff', 'work', 'contact', 'release', 'case', 'case', 'flight', 'travel', 'country', 'state', 'press', 'statement', 'entry', 'country', 'entry', 'day', 'arrival', 'report', 'dock', 'port', 'everglades', 'port', 'everglades', 'centers', 'ship', 'dock', 'cruises', 'sailing', 'disembarkation', 'test', 'crew', 'member', 'order', 'health', 'resources', 'email', 'statement', 'woman', 'case', 'school', 'function', 'child', 'order', 'health', 'page', 'press', 'conference', 'case', 'woman', 'return', 'press', 'release', 'issue', 'report', 'case', 'state', 'woman', 'issue', 'woman', 'family', 'member', 'contact', 'time', 'day', 'home', 'page', 'health', 'home', 'court', 'order', 'page', 'page', 'people', 'school', 'function', 'possibility', 'exposure', 'member', 'family', 'exhibit', 'symptom']"

Republican Rep. Mark Meadows, President Trump's new chief of staff, is in self-quarantine as a protective measure, his office said.
""Rep. Meadows was advised this weekend that he may have come in contact with the (Conservative Political Action Conference) attendee who tested positive for COVID-19, now 12 days ago,"" said Ben Williamson, Meadow's chief of staff.
Meadows was not scheduled to start his new job this week, an official said.
Some background: Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona announced that they would self-quarantine after coming into contact with an individual who has been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus at the recent CPAC.
Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas was told by officials over the weekend that he had also been in proximity to the individual, but he is not planning to self-quarantine, a Gohmert aide tells CNN, details the congressman himself confirmed on Twitter on Monday evening.
Japan's Health Ministry have announced an additional 26 cases of novel coronavirus.
The additional cases bring the country's total to 1,210 confirmed cases.
Vietnam confirmed one new case of novel coronavirus, bringing the nationwide tally to 31, according to a government statement.
The new case is a 49-year old British national who was on the same Vietnam Airlines' flight with a previously confirmed patient who flew from the United Kingdom to Vietnam on March 2.
He is the eighth British national and the 10th foreign patient confirmed in Vietnam who was on board that flight.
Of the 31 patients confirmed in Vietnam so far, 16 had been discharged.
The United Kingdom has advised its citizens on Monday “against all but essential travel to Italy, due to an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus,” according to a statement from Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).
The advisory came after Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced at a news conference on Monday that the whole country of Italy is now on lockdown.
“British nationals remain able to depart Italy without restriction,” the FCO said.
However, airline schedules are subject to change and some flights are being cancelled,” the FCO added.
People infected by novel coronavirus tend to develop symptoms about five days after exposure, and almost always within two weeks, according to a study released Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.
That incubation period is consistent with previous estimates from public health officials, and the findings suggest that 14 days of quarantine are appropriate for people potentially exposed to the coronavirus.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has used that standard during the current pandemic — recommending, for example, that people self-quarantine for two weeks after traveling to countries with widespread coronavirus transmission, such as Italy or South Korea.
To estimate the incubation period, researchers scoured more than 180 reports of coronavirus in places without widespread transmission of the virus — areas, in other words, where infection was likely due to outside travel.
Because the study was conducted early in the coronavirus epidemic, community transmission at the time was limited to Wuhan, China.
That allowed researchers to estimate the “time of exposure” to the coronavirus by determining when a person was in Wuhan — the only plausible source of infection.
By comparing travel to Wuhan with the emergence of symptoms, researchers could then estimate an incubation period for the virus: usually about five days, and rarely more than 12.
It’s possible, the researchers said, that their study may have focused on more severe cases of the virus – which are likelier to make the news and catch the attention of public health officials.
The incubation for mild cases, then, might differ somewhat.
Of the 80,000 confirmed coronavirus cases reported in China, ""more than 70% have recovered and been discharged,"" according to the World Health Organization (WHO) in a news conference on Monday.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus addressed the outbreak in his opening remarks, saying it's important to remember ""of all the cases reported globally so far, 93% are from just four countries."" The director-general emphasized that the situation can still be controlled.
""The bottom line is,"" Tedros said, ""we are not at the mercy of this virus."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said oil market changes were a large component in the day’s earlier stock market decline.
So we saw an overnight reaction of over down 20% and that’s obviously what had a major component today on the stock market,” Mnuchin said Monday at a White House press briefing.
Mnuchin also said the US is moving into the economic bumpiness from a good place.
“We couldn’t be more pleased that coming into the situation with the coronavirus the US has the most resilient economy in the world.
We are committed and we just had a meeting with the President and the economic team,” he said.
Mnuchin described what new economic initiatives the President will propose tomorrow.
This is about providing proper tools and liquidity to get through the next few months,” Mnuchin added.
The Trump administration will soon release guidance on how to keep workplaces, schools, homes and commercial businesses safe from novel coronavirus, Dr. Deborah Birx, coronavirus task force coordinator, said Monday.
She told reporters at a White House press briefing that the guidance will be provided later Monday.

An Italian woman has been unable to leave her apartment where her husband’s dead body is being kept due to quarantine restrictions, Giancarlo Canepa, mayor of Borghetto Santo Spirito, told CNN Tuesday.
The husband, who had tested positive for coronavirus previously, died Monday at 2 a.m. local time.
“Yes, it is true she is still there with the body and we won’t be able to remove it until Wednesday morning,“ the mayor said.
Canepa said quarantine protocol states that no one is allowed to approach the body.
“Unfortunately, we have a security protocol we must follow,” he said.
The mayor also said that the man refused to be taken to the local hospital for recovery, which led to this situation.
“Otherwise, this wouldn’t have happened,” he said.
The story made headlines in Italy as stories emerged of the wife’s despair at remaining locked up with her husband’s dead body for hours on end.
Local television station IVG.IT posted video interviews with the woman’s neighbors who had just found out that their neighbor had passed away.
“Right now the most important thing is to think about this lady, alone with the body of her husband… No one can come close to help her nor comfort her.
Our thoughts are with her and on what she is living through,” the neighbor said on video and whose name was not made public.

70 cases are repatriated from overseas, like citizens evacuated from China or the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan.
1,197 cases were detected and confirmed on US soil, spread out across 43 states and Washington, DC.
These figures include presumptive positive cases -- meaning the patient tested positive in a public health lab and is pending confirmation from the CDC.
The US death toll is now at 38, after another patient died in Washington state.
Europe appears to have been largely blindsided by President Trump’s announcement earlier today that the US was suspending travel from 26 European countries.
Several European ambassadors in Washington tell CNN they didn’t know this was coming, despite having been in contact with the administration over the past few days.
One ambassador in DC said there was “no indication” Trump would go to the lengths he did, while another spokesperson said German officials had no advanced warning this was coming.
The Trump administration notified ambassadors after the announcement: Several European ambassadors expressed a need for clarity as they worked to digest what these new measures mean.
They had received calls from the State Department after the announcement -- but they ""have not yet answers to our questions,” said one ambassador.
State Department officials say they didn’t know precisely what Trump was going to roll out, given the fact that multiple options were on the table.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with the Australian Foreign Minister less than five hours before Trump’s address -- and gave no indication of the announcement coming tonight, according to a source familiar with the meeting.

Stanford and health officials are now working to conduct contact tracing on the patients.
The letter added that the university would not provide additional information on the patients to protect their privacy.
Stanford is holding online classes: The university canceled all in-person classes for the final two weeks of its winter quarter, and will continue with online classes during the spring quarter.

Mainland China reported 15 new coronavirus cases yesterday -- continuing the week-long trend of dramatically falling numbers, according to China's National Health Commission.
Six of those cases were imported from overseas -- meaning they weren't locally transmitted in China.
Hubei province, where the coronavirus pandemic began back in December, reported eight new cases -- the lowest to be reported from Hubei since the outbreak began.
The drop in new daily cases is especially striking given that just a month or two ago, the country was reporting around 2,000 new cases per day.
China has now reported 80,793 cases and 3,169 deaths.
Of the total cases, 62,793 have recovered and been discharged from hospital, according to the NHC.

Colorado is the latest state to shut down elementary and secondary schools to combat the spread of coronavirus.
In a statement, Gov. Jared Polis said he signed an executive order suspending in-person teaching and both public and private schools across the state.
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced Wednesday the state’s first death due to novel coronavirus.
According to a statement from the governor, the patient was a Prince George’s County resident in his 60s, who suffered from an underlying medical condition.
At least 85 cases of coronavirus have been reported in Maryland.
Rep. Ben McAdams, a Democrat from Utah, tweeted Wednesday that he tested positive for coronavirus.
He said he first felt symptoms on Saturday after returning from Washington, and was tested on Tuesday.
He received the positive result on Wednesday.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic Wednesday night, telling CNN “there’s a massive national crisis going on and he’s consistently late and very marginal in what he does.” De Blasio said the federal government is absent in the discussion right now and noted the President is “the Herbert Hoover of his generation.” He added that the President “has not done anything to maximize the amount of medical supplies being produced and to ensure they are being distributed where they are needed most in the United States."" President Trump signed into law a coronavirus relief package that includes provisions for free testing for COVID-19 and paid emergency leave.
The Senate had earlier Wednesday approved the House-passed bill.
The move allowed the upper chamber to devote its full attention to passing the next relief package in response to the coronavirus crisis.
According to the White House, the ""Families First Coronavirus Response Act"" will provide ""supplemental appropriations related to the COVID-19 public health emergency, as well as waivers and modifications of Federal nutrition programs, employment-related protections and benefits, health programs and insurance coverage requirements, and related tax credits during the COVID-19 public health emergency."" Australian airline Qantas and its subsidiary Jetstar will suspend scheduled international flights from late March until at least the end of May due to the coronavirus crisis.
In a statement posted on its website Thursday, Qantas Group announced that 60% of its domestic flights would also be cut, and two-thirds of its 30,000 employees would be temporarily stood down.
There's the possibility of ad-hoc international flights, the group said in its statement.
The US Food and Drug Administration has now authorized nine coronavirus tests for emergency use.
The maker of one of those tests, Abbott, promised on Wednesday to ship 150,000 laboratory tests “immediately."" The authorizations are somewhat of a formality.
FDA guidance issued earlier this week allows companies to manufacture and ship tests before receiving permission.
Yet the authorizations still offer a stamp of approval to tests, signaling that federal regulators are satisfied with their validation data and believe their benefits outweigh any risks, such as false positives or negatives.
Four other tests were authorized by the FDA this week; Abbott’s test is the fifth, for a total of nine.
Unlike tests that give results at home or in a doctor’s office, coronavirus tests must be run on specialized equipment in clinical labs.
The Abbott system can process up to 470 tests per day, according to the company, whose test was authorized Tuesday.
The Swiss firm Roche, whose test was greenlit last week, says its systems can process up to 960 results in eight hours.
Such “high-throughput” systems have the potential to dramatically increase testing capacity in the United States.
But shortages of the people and tools needed to run the tests – like health care workers and cotton swabs – could still slow testing.",2020-03-17,"['state', 'soccer', 'field', 'use', 'hospital', 'people', 'facility', 'shoreline', 'design', 'bed', 'announcement', 'city', 'shoreline', 'hospital', 'bed', 'people', 'affiliate', 'group', 'worker', 'construction', 'material', 'field', 'city', 'hospital', 'city', 'regulation', 'permit', 'state', 'school', 'combat', 'statement', 'sign', 'order', 'person', 'teaching', 'school', 'state', 'state', 'death', 'statement', 'resident', 'condition', 'case', 'report', 'test', 'symptom', 'return', 'test', 'result', 'city', 'blasio', 'criticize', 'response', 'night', 'crisis', 'blasio', 'government', 'discussion', 'generation', 'amount', 'supply', 'states', 'sign', 'law', 'relief', 'package', 'provision', 'testing', 'emergency', 'chamber', 'devote', 'attention', 'relief', 'package', 'response', 'crisis', 'families', 'response', 'appropriation', 'health', 'emergency', 'modification', 'nutrition', 'program', 'employment', 'protection', 'benefit', 'health', 'program', 'insurance', 'requirement', 'tax', 'credit', 'health', 'emergency', 'subsidiary', 'schedule', 'flight', 'end', 'crisis', 'statement', 'website', 'group', 'flight', 'employee', 'possibility', 'ad', 'flight', 'group', 'statement', 'food', 'drug', 'administration', 'test', 'emergency', 'use', 'maker', 'test', 'promise', 'ship', 'test', 'authorization', 'formality', 'guidance', 'issue', 'week', 'company', 'ship', 'test', 'permission', 'authorization', 'offer', 'approval', 'test', 'regulator', 'validation', 'benefit', 'risk', 'test', 'week', 'test', 'test', 'result', 'home', 'doctor', 'office', 'test', 'equipment', 'lab', 'system', 'process', 'test', 'day', 'company', 'test', 'test', 'week', 'system', 'process', 'result', 'hour', 'throughput', 'system', 'increase', 'testing', 'capacity', 'states', 'shortage', 'people', 'test', 'health', 'care', 'worker', 'testing']"
46,"CNN's town hall on the coronavirus, addressing facts, fears, and medical guidance, has now finished.
Here's what was discussed: Vaccine trials: CNN medical analyst Dr. Celine Gounder, a clinical assistant professor of infectious diseases, said it is just the ""very beginning"" of a long process of research and studies.
Reinfection: Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said while ""there is no design study that has proven that you are 'protected'"" from getting reinfected, ""projecting what we know about viruses, I would say that there is a very good chance that you're protected."" Young people need to take pandemic seriously: ""We are getting more and more information that someone can transmit even when they are asymptomatic.
So in order to protect oneself, society and particularly the vulnerable people, we've really got to adhere to the physical separation,"" said Fauci.
Increased contact tracing can help save lives: Mike Ryan, director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program said that, ""it is possible to do contact tracing even under the most difficult circumstances, but it does require a real scale-up in public health capacity."" Assessing your own mental health: Psychologist and author Dr. Gretchen Schmelzer  likened the public's response to the coronavirus to the stages of grief, and encouraged people to find ""coping strategies"" to keep their stress levels down.
Question: At CNN's coronavirus town hall Thursday, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta asked psychologist and author Dr. Gretchen Schmelzer about the best ways for people to manage and assess there own mental health, especially considering that for many, the pandemic is not a single traumatic even but rather a long period of significant change.
Answer: Schmelzer likened the public's response to the coronavirus to the stages of grief, and encouraged people to find ""coping strategies"" to keep their stress levels down.
All 40 million residents in the state of California have been ordered to stay home to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
The state is one of the worst affected in the US after Washington and New York.
There are now 910 coronavirus cases in California, including 19 deaths.
New York has at least 5,298 cases, while Washington has at least 1,376 confirmed cases.
Question: Jackie Stephens, a 65-year-old grandmother with underlying health conditions from Idaho, wants to know how best to explain to her ""timid, easily frightened"" 3-year-old grandson that he can't come into physical contact with her.
Answer: Psychologist and author Dr. Gretchen Schmelzer recommended telling Stephens' grandson that ""right now, grandma needs a special bubble."" ""Young children can understand that there is a way to stay connected, even if they can't be be held,"" Schmelzer said, though she acknowledged it is ""hard for both parties."" Schmelzer recommended talking and maybe reading stories to each other online through video messaging apps like Skype or Facetime.
She added that it's important the grandchildren ""are still feeling the love."" ""There's different ways of staying connected."" CNN Correspondent Will Ripley is joining the town hall from Tokyo, Japan -- where a debate is ongoing on the future of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.
""In less than an hour the Olympic Torch is going to be arriving here in Japan.
And officials continue to insist they're moving forward to host the Olympics on schedule at the end of July,"" Ripley said.
""Can the world feel confident given, you know, we're seeing such limited testing here?"" Will the Olympics go ahead?
The coming weeks will tell: ""I have no reason to believe they're not making progress in Japan,"" said Mike Ryan, director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program.
""And the Olympics is a major global event.
And I think Japan still has hope the Olympics will happen, but that is going to be based on a risk management decision.
And obviously the government of Japan will not make a decision to go ahead if there is danger to athletes, danger to spectators.
And a lot of that will depend on how the disease evolves in the coming few weeks."" The Indian government has prohibited the export of masks, ventilators and raw textile materials for masks and coveralls.
India's Minister of Commerce, Piyush Goyal, confirmed the news in a tweet, and said the action has been taken in a ""bid to utilize the nation’s resources for the well being of Indian citizens."" The news comes a day after the country issued fresh guidelines, banning all international commercial passenger flights from landing in India from March 22.
The directive will be in place for a week.
The Indian government is directing state governments to advise citizens above 65 and children below 10 to stay home.
This excludes public representatives, medical professionals and government employees.
States have also been requested to enforce work from home for private sector employees, except those working in emergency or essential services.
There are more than 190 confirmed cases in India and four deaths.
CNN's Anderson Cooper and Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta speak to Mike Ryan, director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program about the US' capacity to test for the coronavirus and do contact tracing.
Learning from Italy: ""I think other countries really, really need to step up and learn the lessons that are being learned in Italy right now.
We have to push this virus back.
It's good to have that, it's great to separate people, but we have to be able to go after the virus,"" Ryan said.
Tailoring responses: ""You've got 50 states.
You've got a different situation in each of those states.
And you need to tailor the responses in each of those states.
And if you've got a chance you need to go after the virus.
And contact tracing and isolation of cases is still a strategy that can be used,"" Ryan said.
Question on problems with testing in US: ""If you don't test people, you don't know they're positive.
Therefore, they may be positive and you don't have time to contact trace them because you don't know they have it,"" Cooper said.
Need to identify cases: ""It's really important we identify all confirmed cases.
We need to test suspected cases.
We need those cases to be isolated, and it is difficult in a very intense environment.
It's difficult to do the kind of detailed contact tracing.
In Ebola, at the peak of the outbreak, we were tracing 25,000 contacts a day in the middle of a war zone.
It is possible to do contact tracing even under the most difficult circumstances, but it does require a real scale-up in public health capacity.
And where that can be done and the virus can be pushed back, we can save lives,"" Ryan said.
CNN's Dan Simon and Gary Tuchman joined the coronavirus town hall from San Francisco and Georgia's St. Simons Island.
Things were very different in the two locations.
The scene in San Francisco: ""What police are looking for, is they want voluntary compliance.
And I have to tell you, for the most part, they're getting it,"" Simon said.
People can go outside to get groceries or grab fresh air -- as some were seen doing behind Simon on the city's shoreline looking out toward the Golden Gate Bridge.
The scene in St. Simons: Things are much different in Georgia's beach towns, which are  popular spring break destinations, according to Tuchman.
""The major partying will take place after 10-11 o'clock tonight.
And the beaches, they are crowded,"" Tuchman said.
Tuchman said a minority of beachgoers were attempting to distance themselves, but most were not.

“We will continue to explore ways to help in this time of crisis."" An annual tradition for both Washingtonians and tourists are to see the cherry blossoms bloom every Spring.
But the threat of spreading coronavirus has prompted the city's public transit system to take additional steps to its already altered scheduled to discourage people from using the public transportation system to go see them during peak bloom.
Trains will be running on a 30-minute operating schedule, and buses will operate on a Sunday schedule, system officials announced in a Friday statement.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority also reminded riders two of its stations — Smithsonian and Arlington Cemetery — close to the Tidal Basin where much of the cherry blossoms bloom will remain closed.
Of course, people continue to show up and look at the bloom, including somebody who broke one of the fragile trees, according to the National Park Service.
Organizers of the National Cherry Blossom Festival had already announced last week it would be canceling its annual event due to the coronavirus outbreak.
For people who are stuck in the nation's capital or otherwise can't get to DC, the National Mall has a webcam to view the cherry blossoms around the Tidal Basin.
The US Food and Drug Administration said Friday that it is closely watching the market and will take appropriate action against firms claiming to offer fraudulent coronavirus tests, preventions and treatments.
The FDA said it is starting to see unauthorized home tests being marketed by some companies.
The FDA has not authorized any home test, although the agency said it is working with test developers to create one.
The FDA said it has already sent warning letters to companies that were selling and promoting coronavirus related items that were fakes.
The agency said it is also stepping up enforcement at ports of entry, including at international mail facilities.
In a separate investigation, US Customs and Border Protection services seized fake test kits at the Los Angeles International Airport on Saturday.

Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel announced on Friday that the country will be closing its borders to everyone attempting to enter the island, with the exception of residents of the communist-run island.
The measure will go into effect on Tuesday and will last 30 days, the President said during a live televised address to the nation.
However, tourism will no longer be permitted for at least 30 days, and all foreign visitors who are not residents need to depart the island, Diaz-Canel said.
Cuban health authorities have reported 21 cases of coronavirus and one death.
Yosemite National Park in California is now closed until further notice.
Visitors are not permitted inside the park, and the closure will be enforced around the clock, according to the National Park Service.
Most national parks have announced facility closures, but this is the first full closure of a park.
The NPS attributes the closure to a request from the local health department.
Known for its towering granite cliffs, Yosemite is one of the country’s most treasured national parks.
Established in 1890, it was the country’s third national park.
New numbers from the Covid-19 outbreak in Italy show more men are dying from the virus than women, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator told CNN.
“This new data about the male-female ratio is really quite striking,” Dr. Deborah Birx told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday evening.
Birx stressed the importance of underlying and pre-existing medical conditions when it comes to coronavirus infections.
“In Italy, again, most of the individuals who succumb to this disease had three other prior existing medical conditions,” she said.

The government of Italy has made a direct appeal to Defense Secretary Mark Esper for US military aid in combating coronavirus, according to a US defense official.
Specifically, Italy's defense minister has asked Esper for critical medical equipment like masks and ventilators as Italy has nearly 60,000 confirmed cases and has had more than 5,000 deaths.
The Italian government has requested that US military personnel stationed in Italy assist Italian authorities by providing medical personnel and field hospitals in support of Italian troops already responding to the crisis there.
Esper recently made the Defense Department’s stockpile of masks and ventilators available to civilian hospitals in the US to help respond to the pandemic.
The military has activated units capable of constructing field hospitals to help relieve the burden on civilian hospitals.
The Italian plea for assistance from its NATO ally comes as the Russian military has made a very public effort to provide the Italians with assistance, using military aircraft to fly in medical personnel and equipment.

Amazon says it has reached out to every state attorney general to help monitor price gouging.
Cuban officials on Monday announced they are limiting travel throughout the island and abroad for their citizens and closed all schools starting Tuesday for nearly a month to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
The Cuban government will “regulate” Cubans ability to leave the communist-run island, said Cuban Prime Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz, “to protect their health, their family neighbors and work comrades.” Marrero said Cubans would need to present a “humanitarian reason” for travel abroad and for Cubans traveling between different provinces on the island.
Last week, Cuban officials said tourism is banned on the island starting Tuesday and that all Cuban and foreign residents returning from abroad would have to undergo supervised quarantine for 14 days.
Despite that announcement, Marrero said, more than 32,000 foreign tourists remained on the island.
Starting Tuesday, he announced, tourists would be banned from leaving their hotels as the government worked to return them to their home countries.
“No one can go into the street,” Marrero said of the tourists.
School classes would be suspended starting Tuesday until at least April 20, he announced.
All Cubans are required to study in state-run schools.
So far, Cuba has announced the island has 40 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 1,036 people have been hospitalized for observation.
Marrero also announced that Cubans waiting in “colas” or long lines for hard to find items would need to keep at least one meter (approximately 3 feet) in distance from other people.
He said additional police would be dispatched throughout the island to enforce the new measures.
In a statement released Monday night, United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee CEO Sarah Hirshland and Chair Susanne Lyons said that the organization has heard the concerns from Team USA athletes regarding the upcoming 2020 Games, and that the “path toward postponement is the most promising.” Hirshland and Lyons continued: “We encourage the IOC to take all needed steps to ensure the Games can be conducted under safe and fair conditions for all competitors.” Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee issued a new order Monday night that requires residents to stay at home for the next two weeks.
""This weapon — distancing ourselves — is the only weapon we have against this virus,"" Inslee said in a televised address.
One of Chicago’s leading children’s hospitals had to scrap plans to host a mobile testing site, which was scheduled Tuesday on the city’s north side after it said both of its vendors weren’t able to fill orders for testing supplies.
It’s another example of how difficult it can be to get tested for Covid-19.
Julie Pesch, spokesperson for Lurie’s Children’s Hospital, told CNN the site was designed to be for pediatric patients not admitted to the hospital who are experiencing symptoms of the virus.
The hospital was hoping to alleviate an onslaught of pressure both its hospital and individual pediatricians across the city are facing.
But because of the high demand for testing and a lack of testing supplies like nasal swabs, those plans were cut short on Friday.
“Our normal operational process is to hold 2-4 days of supply on a product like this.
Last week (March 16) when we went to purchase an elevated quantity, due to the Covid-19 needs, we were informed by both our primary and secondary vendors that they were not able to fill orders,” Pesch said The hospital was hoping parents with an appointment would be able to get a child tested every 15 minutes.
But now the hospital says sick patients will need to go through their regular pediatricians for testing.
The lack of supplies to launch such an effort “is a big deal,” Pesch said.
“The more testing that we can do, that means the less children that we have in the emergency department, in the pediatrician's office.
That is the main message that we’re trying to get across.” “Other hospitals are in the same situation,” said Danny Chun, spokesperson for the Illinois Health and Hospital Association.
The lack of testing supplies remain a problem, he added.
The Advocate Aurora Health hospital system announced Friday that it was suspending a similar program that had already launched because of the national shortage of test kit supplies.
A Fort Jackson, South Carolina, officer and a soldier have both tested positive for Covid-19, according to a statement Monday.
Both service members are in isolation and receiving the necessary medical care, and the Fort Jackson Public Health Team is working to identify anyone else who may have been exposed to the virus, according to the statement from Fort Jackson Commander Brig.
Beagle Jr. Following the announcement of the two cases, Fort Jackson tweeted to visitors, urging them ""to plan ahead and to expect delays at Gates 1, 2, and 4"" as ""the Department of the Army Security Guards are conducting a general health & welfare assessment, including a temperature check, of everyone entering Fort Jackson."" First lady Melania Trump has been tested for coronavirus and is doing fine, President Trump said at Monday's briefing.
This is the first time the President confirmed his wife was also tested for Covid-19.
The President, Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence have all been tested for coronavirus, and all were negative.
“The first lady was tested on the same night as President Trump was tested, out of an abundance of caution.
The test was negative,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told CNN.
Both Trumps were tested at the White House on March 13.

New Zealand has recorded a 30% jump in coronavirus cases as the country heads into lockdown by the end of day Wednesday, according to Ashley Bloomfield, the country's Director of Health.
There are 47 new confirmed cases and three new probable cases, bringing the Pacific nation's count up to 205, Bloomfield said at a news conference on Wednesday.
What is a probable case?
New Zealand is including probable cases in its national count going forward, which includes people who present with coronavirus symptoms and have exposure history despite a negative test.
Bloomfield said the government will continue to see a rise for the next 10 days before a turnaround.
There are at least 52,976 cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States and 704 people have died, according to CNN Health’s tally of US cases that are detected and tested in the US through public health systems.
There have already been 163 deaths reported today, according to a tally by CNN, making this the deadliest day in the US since the coronavirus pandemic began.
The total includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories, as well as all repatriated cases.
A new emergency order from Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak prohibits people from gathering in groups of 10 or more due to the coronavirus pandemic.
It comes as Sisolak says the state is still struggling to determine how many people have been affected by Covid-19.
""Nevada has submitted four requests for Covid-19 testing components,” the governor said.
“We have received zero shipments for Covid-19 testing components.” Hours after Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor told CNN the administration will start wielding the powers in the Defense Production Act for 60,000 tests kits and ""use the allocation portion of the DPA,” FEMA press secretary Lizzie Litzow said the agency was able to procure the kits from the private market.
Earlier Tuesday, Trump and Gaynor contradicted each other on whether the Defense Production Act was being used in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
Around 8 a.m. Tuesday, Trump tweeted, ""The Defense Production Act is in full force, but haven't had to use it because no one has said NO!
Millions of masks coming as back up to States."" Minutes later, Gaynor told CNN the administration was going to use the law.
""Just a little while ago my team came in and we're actually going to use the DPA for first time today,"" Gaynor said.
In addition, FEMA will ""insert some language into these mask contracts we have of 500 million masks,"" Gaynor said.
""DPA language will be in that today."" Trump suggested at Tuesday’s afternoon briefing that his recent authorization of the DPA serves as enough “leverage” to compel companies to produce medical supplies without invoking the act to force them to start up production.
The Nevada primary scheduled for June 9 will go ahead as scheduled, but will be conducted only with absentee ballots, Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske announced Tuesday evening.
The state said all active registered voters will automatically receive a ballot in the mail.
Voters can either mail in their ballot or drop it off at a designated location in each county.
Every county will have at least one poll worker in at least one location to accommodate voters who registered too late to receive an absentee ballot.
Mail-in ballots can be postmarked by Election Day, but must be received by election officials within the following seven days to be counted.

Australia banned overseas travel and extended social restrictions in order to tackle the spread of the novel coronavirus, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Tuesday.
The decision to ban overseas travel is aligned with Australia's upgraded ""Level 4: do not travel"" and comes under the Biosecurity Act of 2015, Morrison said.
To that effect, the Australian prime minister unveiled stricter social distancing measures that include weddings with a maximum attendance of no more than five people and funerals with no more than 10 people, with one person per 4 square metre (or at least 6 feet apart).

Alaska Airlines – which is based in Seattle and primarily serves the Pacific Northwest – is announcing it will cut its flight schedule by 70% for at least the next two months.
In a statement, the company says demand for its flights has fallen by more than 80%, forcing dramatic reductions.
Alaska Airlines says it is cutting contract and temporary jobs and suspending annual pay increases.
The airline also is offering employees the opportunity to take a voluntarily leave of absence.
Alaska Airlines CEO Brad Tilden will forgo his pay through September 30, as will president Ben Minicucci, according to the airline.
Additional pay cuts will be made in the executive ranks — all the way down to vice president level — and the board of directors will receive no pay.
The moves are being made as the company actively lobbies the federal government to pass a relief package for the airline industry.
The US Army has reached out to retired medical personnel to possibly volunteer to support the coronavirus response effort.
In an email obtained by CNN, the Army called upon retired personnel on Wednesday looking for “voluntary recall of retired soldiers” with specific medical specialties.
The Army is asking for help from retired soldiers qualified in these specialties: “60F: Critical Care Officer; 60N: Anesthesiologist; 66F: Nurse Anesthetist; 66S: Critical Care Nurse; 66P: Nurse Practitioner; 66T: ER Nurse; 68V: Respiratory Specialist; 68W: Medic.” A spokesperson for the Army said they’re “gauging the availability and capabilities of our retired career medical personnel to potentially assist with Covid-19 pandemic response efforts if needed.” The spokesperson made clear they do not want to interfere in any civilian medical needs, stating, “This information request will no way interfere with any care they may be providing to their communities, it is for future planning purposes only, and is completely voluntary."" The Pentagon confirmed Wednesday a Marine who works inside the building has tested positive for Covid-19.
A defense official said the last time the Marine, an officer, was in the Pentagon was March 13.

This is the first military person based at the Pentagon to test positive.
Separately, a staff who works in the Pentagon’s National Military Command Center is awaiting test results, a second defense official confirmed.

Boeing, which recently asked lawmakers for a massive financial aid package to prop up its industry, could qualify for a special $17 billion slice of the proposed $2 trillion stimulus package.
It's not clear, however, whether the company would actually take the funds.
The aerospace giant is among the companies that would qualify for the government-backed loans reserved ""for businesses critical to maintaining national security,"" and the only one that has made it clear that it needs the assistance.
The company is intricately linked to both the US government and the nation's economy.
It is the country's largest exporter, is a major government contractor, and consistently ranks among the top 10 companies lobbying federal officials, with millions spent annually.
The company has also come under scrutiny from lawmakers and the Federal Aviation Administration after two fatal 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people and internal documents showed the company mocked and belittled its regulators.
Some context: Boeing said last week that ""a minimum of $60 billion"" in public and private loans is necessary ""to manage the pressure on the aviation sector and the economy as a whole."" It said it would share ""much of any liquidity support to Boeing"" with its vast network of suppliers.
On a series of conference calls with House Democrats today, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made clear she is already thinking about the substance of the fourth coronavirus relief package that Congress will have to pass to respond to the crisis, according to sources on the calls.
She is making clear to her members who are disappointed that the pending stimulus bill did not include enough of their priorities that they will have a chance to add those provisions in the fourth package, the source said.
The comments come as Pelosi told CNN tonight that she does not think the current $2 trillion stimulus bill will help keep the economy afloat beyond a few months.
""I don't think we have enough to go the three months,"" she told CNN.
At New York City’s Bellevue Hospital, a makeshift morgue including tents and refrigerated trucks is being set up in preparation for what may be a surge in the need for autopsies.
""We're in a public health crisis, and the city has declared a state of emergency.
As part of that declaration, agencies like OCME have enacted emergency contingency plans to help prepare for every possible outcome,” New York City’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said in a statement to CNN.
A similar plan was utilized after September 11 attacks.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has a request from New York and other states for assistance in mortuary operations.
“FEMA’s National Response Coordination Center (NRCC) has received requests for HHS Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Teams (DMORT) from the States of Hawaii, New York, and North Carolina.
These requests are currently in the review and approval process,” a FEMA spokesperson told CNN.
New York City has longstanding contracts with companies to also provide refrigerated trucks to store bodies, but that plan has not been put in to effect just yet.
If and when it is, those trucks would likely be stationed at various locations including makeshift hospitals such as the Javits Center.

Although the United States government is making every effort to provide necessary supplies in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, supplies will only help so much, Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said at a town hall for the American Society of Anesthesiologists on Thursday.
“We will not supply our way out of this problem,” he said.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force has provided 9 million N95 respirators from the Strategic National Stockpile, and it has worked with manufacturers to increase production of N95 respirators to 100 million a month, according to Adams.
He also said the national stockpile purchases 0.1% of all national supplies, while the remaining 99.9% are utilized by commercial and private markets.
Other ways to increase supplies are elimination of elective surgeries and converting anesthesia ventilators to ICU ventilators, according to Adams.
He also talked about the importance of testing.
“By this time next week, we expect to be close to two million tests,” he said.
Other than provision of medical supplies to areas that need them most, Adams reiterated the importance of the general public taking social distancing and good hygiene practices seriously.
According to Adams, the disease runs its course about six to eight weeks after strict social distancing, as seen in China and other parts of Asia.
By decreasing the number of infected people, he explained, the demand for supplies would also decrease.
“The way we get out of this crisis is to lower demand,” he said.

Like all Americans, Katie Ledecky has been forced to adjust her lifestyle under self-quarantine as the country struggles against the coronavirus pandemic.
Ledecky shared how she is training during this challenging time during an interview on CNN's coronavirus town hall Thursday night.
One of the motivations for Ledecky to stay in shape are the Olympic games which have been postponed to 2021.
""Goal setting has been crucial to me and keeps me motivated every day to get out of bed and work out hard.
Hopefully that, hopefully we can continue to fight this disease and reduce the spread and be able to compete in Tokyo.
But I think when we get there, it's going to be a true celebration of the world being able to come together again,"" she said.
Countless sporting events have been canceled or postponed around the world over the coronavirus pandemic.
The most notable is the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, which has been postponed until 2021.
Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Katie Ledecky joined CNN's ongoing town hall to talk about the postponement.
The next steps forward will depend on the new dates for 2021, which will determine the scheduling for trials and training.
For now, Ledecky is hunkering down and social distancing like everybody else.
""I'm not doing anything besides staying in my apartment trying to stay in shape the best I can,"" she said.
The coronavirus pandemic isn't just having a public health and economic toll on the world -- it threatens our mental health, too.

The rate of increase in the number of cases was doubling every three to four days, but today’s number shows a new rate of increase.
Cases are now doubling less than every two days and if this rate continues, we will be where New York is today, Garcetti said.
These are the loved ones that are in our families and our communities and our workplaces,"" Garcetti added.
The mayor also announced that the city is partnering with fashion brand Reformation to help produce masks with guidance from health care company Kaiser Permanente.
The city has launched LA Projects to collaborate with garment and apparel manufacturers to mass produce non-medical masks for non-medical staff at hospitals, grocery workers, and other Angelenos on the front lines.
The goal is to produce 5 million non-medical masks, Garcetti said.
Earlier this week, Hawaii Governor David Ige asked people to postpone their visits to the state for 30 days, and most people are listening.
In a Thursday evening press conference, Ige said flights to Hawaii this week are down 87% compared to the same week in 2019.
""We must try to stop visitors from coming to Hawaii in order to stop the spread of Covid-19 into our communities,” Gov. Ige said The state is backing up its request for fewer visitors with an order that all arrivals -- residents and visitors -- immediately enter a 14-day quarantine upon entering the state.
“Only 38 total people flew into Kauai's airport (Thursday),” said Tim Sakahara with the state’s Department of Transportation.
Arrivals are interviewed before being allowed to leave the airport, and must fill out a form giving details on where they will be spending their quarantine.

Former Vice President got visibly emotional Friday night when discussing how hard it is to not be there for loved ones dying from coronavirus.
Biden referenced his personal history of losing his wife, children and parents.
He continued: ""And seek help.
Seek help afterwards.
Seek help, talk to people who have been through it so they know, they know they can tell you that you can get through it.
That's one of the cruelest, cruelest things that's happening."" Biden closed out the town hall by encouraging anyone struggling with loss to contact his campaign.
Federal health officials on Friday green-lit a point-of-care coronavirus test that can provide results in less than 15 minutes, using the same technology that powers some rapid flu tests.
Teased by Vice President Mike Pence in a Thursday press briefing, the new diagnostic could accelerate testing in the United States, allowing for rapid results in doctors’ offices.
But shortages of critical equipment used to collect patient specimens, such as masks and swabs, could blunt its impact.
The US Food and Drug Administration authorized the test for emergency use, signaling that federal regulators were satisfied with the test’s validation data and believe its benefits outweigh any risks, such as false positives or negatives.
The test’s maker, Abbott, said it expects to deliver 50,000 tests per day beginning next week.
The platform used to run the test weighs less than 7 pounds, according to Abbott, and could be deployed “where testing is needed most,” such as at coronavirus hotspots.
More on this: Last week, the FDA authorized another rapid test – one from molecular diagnostics company Cepheid, which provides results in about 45 minutes.
Most laboratory tests for the coronavirus take anywhere from a few hours to days to receive results.
All FDA-authorized tests, however, require samples from patients – and health care facilities say they’re facing shortages of critical supplies needed to collect specimens.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday issued guidance allowing some patients to collect their own nasal swabs in health care facilities, which could reduce the amount of protective equipment needed for health care workers.
But some jurisdictions, such as New York City, have said that patients with coronavirus-like illness should stay home – saying that is “safer for the patients and health care workers” and doesn’t change the treatment patients receive.
Joe Biden said he would freeze rent for the next three months and forgive the payments missed amid the coronavirus pandemic.
“Freeze it and forgive it so that you’re able to stay in that place,” the former vice president said in a CNN town hall Friday night.
Biden implied there could be conditions -- noting that enhanced unemployment insurance replacing lost income up to $75,000 per year and $1,200 cash payments approved by Congress this week could replace the income of some people who have lost their jobs, and “then in fact that would take care of it.” Then, Biden added: “There should be a rent freeze.
No one should be evicted during this period -- period.” Today in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered a freeze on eviction enforcement and legal proceedings related to coronavirus through May 31.
Joe Biden praised the $2 trillion stimulus package signed by President Donald Trump today, but worried that the largest emergency aid package in US history might not be enough to save the small businesses ravaged by the crisis.
Biden said the provision in the bill that blocks executives from buying back stock was a good step in assuring that those who need the help get it, but pushed for additional government action if banks don’t start pumping out capital.
They are in a position where we're going to say to the banks you got to get them out the door.
As you know, they're not very good at getting out the door the small business loans,” Biden said.
The former vice president also suggested that, should banks fail to recapitalize those businesses, the White House should consider finding some executive authority – “another version of the Defense Production Act” -- as a way, he said, to “keep the economy in better shape than anything else we're doing.” Joe Biden has run for president essentially promising to be the nation’s healer-in-chief.
He argued during CNN’s coronavirus town hall that America is showing a spirit of togetherness that he hopes will extend well beyond the crisis.
Biden offered an example of a kindergarten teacher in North Carolina who drove from home to home of her students, beeping her horn so they would come out and wave from the driveway for a moment.
He said it took her several hours to get through the neighborhood, but she’s continuing to do it.
Biden, who advanced an initiative to try to beat cancer, said his wife Jill is helping to put together a network to offer support for patients who are dealing with their cancer diagnoses and get through chemotherapy.
“I am so proud, and it sounds corny, but I am proud to be an American,” Biden said.
Joe Biden said Friday that he believes there is “no distinction” between the physical and mental health problems that stem from coronavirus, acknowledging the increasing rates of anxiety and depression as the country uses social isolation to combat the spreading virus.
Biden said he has heard not only about the anxiety that comes from being forced to stay home for long stretches of time, but also the “fear of going into the operating room or the physical fear of pulling someone out of a burning car that, in fact, may also have had the virus.” The comment stemmed from a question clinical psychologist and professor from Chicago, who asked the former vice president about the mental health impact of being socially isolated as the country fights coronavirus.
Biden also said, as president, he would force insurance companies to cover physical and mental health equally and “open a significant number of mental health clinics” in rural America.
“In most rural areas, there's still the same problems as every other area but they don't have these clinics available to them,” Biden said, “so I double the number of mental health clinics that exist.” And, lastly, Biden said he would increase spending on early childhood education because teachers and social workers can “pick up the early signs of distress among students.” There are at least 101,242 cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States, according to CNN Health’s tally of US cases that are detected and tested in the United States through US public health systems.
At least 1,588 people have died in the US from coronavirus.
Today there have been at least 402 new deaths reported.
That is the most deaths reported in the US in a single day.
The previous single day high of deaths reported in the US came yesterday.
There were 253 deaths reported yesterday.
Joe Biden said the House and Senate should expand on the stimulus deal Congress approved this week to cover all Americans’ coronavirus-related health care expenses.
“Anything related to the cost of the coronavirus health care should be free, paid for out of the federal funds,” Biden said in a CNN town hall Friday night.
His comment came as he addressed questions about health expenses amid the pandemic.
Biden called on President Donald Trump and Republican state attorneys general to drop their lawsuit challenging Obamacare, through which millions of Americans have health insurance.
He also said he has proposed a plan that would provide coverage through a “public option” to anyone who loses their jobs as a result of a struggling economy.
“But in the meantime, with regard to this virus, you should not have to pay anything for the cost of the virus,” Biden said.",2020-03-26,"['night', 'love', 'reference', 'history', 'wife', 'child', 'parent', 'help', 'help', 'help', 'talk', 'people', 'thing', 'town', 'loss', 'contact', 'campaign', 'health', 'point', 'care', 'test', 'result', 'minute', 'use', 'technology', 'power', 'flu', 'test', 'press', 'briefing', 'testing', 'states', 'result', 'doctor', 'office', 'shortage', 'equipment', 'use', 'impact', 'food', 'drug', 'administration', 'test', 'emergency', 'use', 'regulator', 'test', 'validation', 'benefit', 'risk', 'test', 'maker', 'test', 'day', 'week', 'platform', 'use', 'test', 'pound', 'testing', 'week', 'test', 'company', 'cepheid', 'result', 'minute', 'test', 'hour', 'day', 'result', 'test', 'health', 'care', 'facility', 'face', 'shortage', 'supply', 'centers', 'issue', 'guidance', 'health', 'care', 'facility', 'amount', 'equipment', 'health', 'care', 'worker', 'jurisdiction', 'city', 'home', 'health', 'care', 'worker', 'change', 'treatment', 'rent', 'month', 'payment', 'place', 'town', 'night', 'condition', 'unemployment', 'insurance', 'income', 'year', 'cash', 'payment', 'week', 'income', 'people', 'job', 'fact', 'care', 'rent', 'period', 'period', 'today', 'order', 'eviction', 'enforcement', 'praise', 'package', 'sign', 'today', 'emergency', 'aid', 'package', 'history', 'business', 'ravage', 'crisis', 'provision', 'stock', 'step', 'help', 'push', 'government', 'action', 'bank', 'pump', 'capital', 'position', 'bank', 'door', 'door', 'business', 'loan', 'bank', 'business', 'version', 'defense', 'production', 'way', 'economy', 'shape', 'promise', 'nation', 'town', 'crisis', 'offer', 'example', 'kindergarten', 'teacher', 'home', 'home', 'student', 'beep', 'horn', 'driveway', 'moment', 'hour', 'neighborhood', 'cancer', 'wife', 'help', 'network', 'offer', 'support', 'deal', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'distinction', 'health', 'problem', 'increase', 'rate', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'country', 'use', 'isolation', 'combat', 'virus', 'anxiety', 'force', 'home', 'stretch', 'time', 'fear', 'room', 'fear', 'car', 'fact', 'virus', 'comment', 'question', 'psychologist', 'health', 'impact', 'country', 'force', 'insurance', 'company', 'cover', 'health', 'number', 'health', 'area', 'problem', 'area', 'number', 'health', 'increase', 'spending', 'childhood', 'education', 'teacher', 'worker', 'sign', 'distress', 'student', 'case', 'states', 'health', 'case', 'test', 'states', 'health', 'system', 'people', 'today', 'death', 'report', 'death', 'report', 'day', 'day', 'death', 'report', 'yesterday', 'death', 'report', 'yesterday', 'deal', 'week', 'cover', 'health', 'care', 'expense', 'cost', 'health', 'care', 'town', 'night', 'comment', 'address', 'question', 'health', 'expense', 'call', 'state', 'attorney', 'challenge', 'health', 'insurance', 'plan', 'option', 'job', 'result', 'economy', 'regard', 'virus', 'cost', 'virus']"

The Zaandam cruise ship has been given permission to cross the Panama Canal and will then head toward Florida, according to a press release issued by the Panama Canal Saturday.
The green light comes a day after the Panama Canal said on Twitter the Zaandam would not be able to use the canal to get to Florida because the ship had passengers on board who tested positive for coronavirus.
Four ""older"" guests have died on the Zaandam and two others have tested positive for coronavirus.
The cause and manner of death for the individuals who have died has not been determined yet.
More than 130 others have displayed flu-like symptoms, according to the cruise line.
Panama’s Ministry of Health approved the passage of the Zaandam for “humanitarian reasons,” the release said.
No passengers or crew members will be allowed to disembark on Panamanian territory, the statement said.
The ship was scheduled to cross the Panama Canal on April 1, but passage could happen earlier, according to the Panama Canal.
There are a total of 1,243 guests and 586 crew on board the Zaandam.
The ship departed Buenos Aires, Argentina, on March 7 and was scheduled to sail to Chile, but has been denied access to ports.
At least 696 members of the New York Police Department have tested positive for coronavirus, according to a daily coronavirus report from the NYPD.
There are 608 uniformed members and 88 civilian members who have tested positive.
About 12% of the department's uniformed workforce -- or 4,342 employees -- were out sick on Saturday, the report said.
President Donald Trump said in a tweet that after consulting with the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, he is asking the CDC to issue ""a strong Travel Advisory"" to be administered by those governors, in consultation with the federal government.
Trump said a ""quarantine will not be necessary."" This comes after he said earlier Saturday that he's considering mandatory short-term (two-week) quarantine on New York, certain parts of New Jersey and Connecticut.
Trump's suggestion of a mandatory quarantine was strongly opposed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who questioned whether it would be legal.
More than 2,000 people have died from the coronavirus in the United States as of 7:45 p.m. EST Saturday, according to a CNN count compiled through data on state health department websites.

A nurse at a downtown New Orleans hospital has described to CNN the very difficult conditions at the facility.
The nurse, who did not want to be identified out of fear that speaking to the media could lead to employment repercussions, described the situation at the hospital after finishing a shift two days ago.
The nurse told CNN that while the situation at the hospital is dire, the staff are in better shape than some.
We only have 16 unused ventilators left in hospital.
We’ve been told the surrounding hospitals are at max capacity without ventilators, leaving our hospital and one other major hospitals left to care for these patients,"" the nurse said.
""EMS are having to recruit volunteer EMT workers to help as New Orleans EMS paramedics are either in quarantine for exposure or sick themselves."" A physician assistant working in the emergency room of a hospital in the New York borough of Queens described an ""every man for themselves"" atmosphere surrounding personal protective equipment (PPE).
CNN is not naming this health care worker because they feared repercussions at the hospital for speaking to the media.
This physician assistant told CNN staff were informed two days ago that they would have to make their N95 mask last for five days and that they have been given tips by management about how to keep them clean.
PPE is being prioritized for those staff working with intubated patients, who are the most at risk of infection, the physician's assistant said.
Intubation is when a tube is inserted through the mouth and into the patient's airway, so the patient can be placed on a ventilator to assist with breathing.
The physician assistant hasn't heard when the hospital will receive more supplies.
The physician assistant described a crowded ER that is essentially doubling as an intensive care unit due to the large numbers of people who need to be intubated due to Covid-19.
“There’s patients everywhere,"" the physician assistant said.
""I think that no one ever expected to need this many supplies in a short period of time,"" the worker said.
The ER worker emphasized that they felt the hospital administration and management's support of staff has been ""pretty impressive"" and that they have been checking in on the ER staff's needs, even helping staff members find hotel rooms so that they do not need to go home and possibly sicken their families.
The physician assistant wanted to emphasize to the public the importance of social distancing to help stop the spread of the virus.
""You need to stay home, you need to stay away from people” they told CNN.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN he would sue Rhode Island if they did not roll back a policy of stopping all cars with New York license plates, but that he expects the two states will be able to work it out amicably.
""That clearly is unconstitutional,"" Cuomo said, adding he understands Rhode Island's goal of trying to slow the spread of coronavirus.
""But there's a point of absurdity, and I think what Rhode Island did is at the point of absurdity.
Again, it is not even legal,"" he said.

Amazon employees at the company’s facility in Staten Island, New York, plan to walk off the job Monday amid allegations the online retail giant has mishandled its response to the coronavirus pandemic.
The walkout will begin at 12:30 p.m. and could involve anywhere between 50 and 200 people, said Christian Smalls, an assistant manager at the facility who is leading the walkout.
Following the walkout, the workers will gather at a nearby public bus stop and speak to the press.
Employees are protesting Amazon’s decision to keep the Staten Island warehouse open despite news of a confirmed case of the virus there last week, Smalls said.
Many more employees have tested positive for the virus at the facility than the company has publicly acknowledged, Smalls said, claiming that as many as five to seven workers have been diagnosed with coronavirus.
US stock futures were lower Sunday night after President Donald Trump announced an extension of the social distancing guidelines to April 30.
Dow futures were down 371 points, or about 1.7%.

After the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of self-swab testing for the novel coronavirus, it will be implemented this week, said Adm. Dr.
Giroir, assistant secretary for US Department of Health and Human Services during a White House press conference Sunday evening.
With this approval, people with suspected coronavirus can use a foam swab in their nose to collect a nasal sample that they then would put in a plastic bag and submit for testing.
Self-swab testing not only could be more comfortable for the general public, but Giroir said that it also eliminates the need for health care workers to change their personal protective equipment each time a test is performed.
""Instead of having a provider stick this all the way in the back of your nose, that's uncomfortable but it also requires PPE changes every time it's done,"" Giroir said.
Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said during a Sunday briefing at the White House that ""we've reviewed 12 different models"" in deciding whether to continue the social distancing guidelines.
Birx emphasized that officials brought ""that data and that evidence to the President to consider for extending, which is not a simple situation when you ask people to stay home for another 30 days."" ""They have to know that we've really built this on scientific evidence and the potential to save really hundreds of thousands of American lives,"" she said.

Eleven veteran residents of the Soldiers’ Home in Holyoke, Massachusetts have died -- and five of them tested positive for coronavirus, Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse confirmed to CNN.
Test results are still pending for five of the remaining veterans.
The status of the last veteran who died is unknown, according to Mike Bloomberg, Morse’s chief of staff.
Soldiers’ Home houses 233 residents and is run by the state of Massachusetts.
Eleven additional veterans and five staff members have also tested positive for Covid-19, Morse said.
Bennett Walsh, the facility’s superintendent, has been placed on paid administrative leave, effective immediately, according to a statement from Massachusetts Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Dan Tsai.
All of the residents at Soldiers’ Home have been isolated and symptomatic employees have been advised to quarantine.
The US Department of Homeland Security's National Operations Center has temporarily moved to an alternate location after an employee tested positive for coronavirus, according to a source familiar with the situation.
Deep cleaning of the office is expected to be completed in the next couple days, the source said.
According to DHS, the Operations Center operates 24 hours a day and serves as the ""primary, national-level hub for situational awareness, a common operating picture, information fusion, information sharing and executive communications."" The relocation was first reported by Yahoo News.
Two weeks after San Francisco issued the country’s first shelter in place order for residents to prevent spread of the novel coronavirus, hospital emergency rooms throughout the region appear to be seeing the early effects.
As of Monday morning, the city reported a total of 374 confirmed infections and six deaths from the virus.
While the availability of testing is still much lower than officials would like, the modest daily count compared to other major urban centers may be an encouraging sign that the early aggressive action in the country’s second most densely populated city is having its intended effect.
“We have already made a difference in saving lives,” San Francisco Mayor London Breed said during a news conference Monday, though she and other officials repeatedly cautioned that US communities are still in the early stages of the battle against the virus.
""We’re watching the data very carefully,” added Dr Grant Colfax, the city’s public health director, cautioning that the numbers could still explode rapidly.
The situation in Los Angeles: But that sense of hope has not necessarily reached Los Angeles County, where hospitals are seeing a steady increase in the number of patients.
Close to 2,500 people are confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus in the county, with 342 new cases reported in the past two days.
Across town at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, doctors expressed more optimism in the early efforts.
“We are cautiously hopeful that there has been a flattening of the steep curve because we have not seen the exponential rise of traffic coming in,” said Dr Anish Mahajan, the hospital’s chief medical officer, referring to the rate of new transmissions.
Harbor-UCLA has seen a steady rise in coronavirus patients in recent days, increasing from 12 patients on Thursday to 35 on Monday.
What the authorities say: At a news conference Monday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom was asked if officials were beginning to see a flattening of the curve of coronavirus patients.
It would be too easy to say what has or has not worked,” Newsom said.
“The stay home effort has bought us time to prepare.” California currently has at least 5,763 coronavirus cases, including 118 deaths.
The Los Angeles Convention Center has been offered to hospitals in Los Angeles County to be used as an additional facility to house more patients, Mayor Eric Garcetti confirmed in a news conference Monday.

Over 3,000 medical professionals have volunteered to help, according to Garcetti.
Hawaii has introduced strict new measures, requiring those who travel between the state's eight major islands to self-isolate for 14 days, Gov. David Ige announced.
The order goes into effect on Tuesday and will last through at least April 30.
Last week, Ige ordered similar mandatory quarantine measures for anyone entering the state by air, regardless of whether they are a resident or a visitor.

Hawaii has 204 confirmed coronavirus cases and no deaths.
The White House told the US state of Illinois that it would receive 300,000 N95 masks -- but instead, the state got surgical masks, says Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.
This was the third federal shipment of PPE Illinois has received and it arrived Sunday.
But the governor said Illinois had so far received only a “small fraction” of what the state had asked for.
The state of Illinois currently has 5,057 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 73 deaths.
Pritzker also called on President Donald Trump to use the Defense Production Act to direct companies to increase PPE production.
All farmers markets in Los Angeles will be temporarily suspended, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced at a news conference today.
The farmers markets have become too crowded, he said.
The city will require all farmers markets to submit plans immediately that enforce physical distancing and ensure safe operations.
Garcetti explained that it will likely result in one entrance and one exit with people safely lined up to enter.
He reminded Los Angeles residents that if there are too many people to simply wait before going.

58,"Two nurses at St. Joseph's Hospital in Denver, Colorado, have told CNN that they're running out of proper sedation drugs because they've had to intubate so many patients since the coronavirus epidemic began in the US.
A nurse at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, tells CNN that their hospital is running out of fentanyl, which they used to sedate intubated Covid-19 patients.
SCL Health Vice President of System Communications Nikki Sloup said that their hospital system, which includes St. Joseph's Hospital, currently has an adequate supply to meet patient needs.
But Sloup warns that if they experience a patient surge, it could see shortages.
CNN reached out to Johns Hopkins Hospital for comment but did receive a response.

Hawaii has reported its first death from the coronavirus, leaving Wyoming as the only US state without a fatality from Covid-19.
The Hawaii victim “was an older adult resident of Oahu” with preexisting health problems, according to Dr. Bruce Anderson with the state Department of Health.
“This is a difficult time for everyone in Hawaii,” Governor David Ige said in a news conference Tuesday evening.
A plane from Russia loaded with personal protective equipment (PPE) and other supplies to assist in the response to Covid-19 is expected to arrive in the United States on Wednesday, a senior administration official tells CNN.
President Trump on Monday told reporters that Russia sent the US “a very, very large planeload of things, medical equipment which was very nice.” Why is Russia sending the equipment?
The Russian embassy in DC tweeted Tuesday that President Vladimir Putin provided the assistance with the consideration that manufacturers would reciprocate and share supplies with Russia if need be.
The National Security Council and State Department did not reply to inquiries as to if President Trump promised that US manufacturers would share supplies with Russia if Russia gets to a point where they need them.
Over the next few weeks, Gov. Brian Kemp will deploy the National Guard to help long-term care facilities, assisted living facilities and nursing homes in Georgia with Covid-19 cases.
The National Guard will help implement infection control protocols and enhance sanitation methods in hopes of mitigating exposure to the vulnerable residents, the governor said in a press release.

El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced the country's first coronavirus death on Twitter Tuesday.
In the short tweet Bukele added, ""God will protect us."" El Salvador has reported 32 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
President Trump on Tuesday again touted anti-malaria drugs as a potential treatment for coronavirus, and extolled their safety, despite the lack of scientific studies on the matter.
Facts First: Trump is right that the drugs have been available for a while, but he’s wrong to imply that they’ve been proven safe for Covid-19 patients.
Public health officials have said testing is still needed, and trials are underway.
Over the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for doctors to use the drugs in hospitals for a limited set of Covid-19 cases.
Some physicians have already been using the malaria drugs off-label to treat coronavirus patients.
The drugs have been used to safely prevent and treat malaria, and for lupus and other conditions.
But there isn’t scientific data proving that they’re safe for coronavirus patients.
There’s no evidence to back up Trump’s assertion that it’s already known that Covid-19 patients won’t die from the treatment.
The drug can lead to cardiac side effects, including an irregular heartbeat, which can be especially dangerous for patients with Covid-19, doctors say.
Early tests are underway now in New York, the hardest hit area in the US with more than 75,000 cases.
This isn’t the first time Trump has made this comment.

59,"Residents of Los Angeles should wear non-medical grade face coverings when in public, the city's mayor Eric Garcetti said in a news conference Tuesday.
Garcetti emphasized that all medical-grade N95 masks were reserved for front-line workers in hospitals and clinics.
Face coverings, like a bandanna, are only effective with safe physical distancing, he added.
There are currently 8,155 cases of the virus in California.
Global debate on face masks: Despite the regular use of masks in Asian countries such as China and South Korea, Western governments have been slow to embrace them to stop the spread of the virus.
But with the number of new cases remaining low or stable in Asia, it appears that more countries in the West may change their approach.
President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the UK and Canada were making plans to repatriate their citizens from two Holland America cruise ships currently off the coast of Florida.
Two cruise ships off Florida coast: Both the Zaandam and the Rotterdam are currently on their way to Florida, and have requested permission to disembark guests.
Since March 22, 83 passengers and 136 crew onboard the Zaandam have exhibited flu-like symptoms.
Eight passengers have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
Four people on the Zaandam have died, but the cause of their deaths is unknown.
On the Rotterdam, 14 passengers have exhibited flu-like symptoms.
Dr. Deborah Birx said a coronavirus antibody test could be available “within this month” and says “I've really called on every university and every state to develop ELISA’s, you can buy the antigens and the controls online, and really work to test entire health care communities in your state and support them that way.” The ELISA, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, test detects and measures antibodies in blood.
If successful, the test could help identify those who have already had the virus, but have since recovered.
Experts say that if a person has had the virus and developed antibodies, it will most likely mean they have built up immunity and the chances of that person being infected again drops dramatically.
Birx said that the test could help identify frontline medical workers who may have had the coronavirus and not know it.
Birx said a first test could be available, “soon, within this month if the universities help us, absolutely.” There have been at least 917 new coronavirus deaths reported in the US on Wednesday, according to a count by CNN Health.
This is the most reported deaths in the United States in a single day since the coronavirus outbreak.
There have been a total of 4,745 deaths reported in the US since the outbreak.
Wyoming remains the only state in the US without a death from coronavirus.
So far, there are 137 positive cases in the state, according to CNN's tally.
Adam Schlesinger, a prolific songwriter for film and television and co-founder of the band Fountains of Wayne, has died from complications of Covid-19.

The Fountains of Wayne song ""Stacy's Mom,"" a pop hit from 2003, was among the group's most popular songs.
The Zaandam and Rotterdam cruise ships are expected to arrive and remain off the coast of Florida early Thursday while they wait for clearance from US authorities, according to a statement from Holland America.
The company made a plea to President Trump, Florida authorities and the public to be allowed to arrive to Florida.
The cruise line called the status on the ships a “humanitarian situation.” Four people on the ship have died and at least eight people have tested positive for Covid-19.
Since March 22, 97 guests (83 on Zaandam and 14 on Rotterdam) and 136 crew on the Zaandam have exhibited flu-like symptoms, according to the statement.
These passengers would stay isolated on board until they recover, per the press release.
Holland America says less than 10 people need immediate critical care onshore and it has secured a local health system to treat them.

Singapore recorded 49 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Thursday, only eight of which had a travel history to Europe, North America or other parts of Asia.
Some 26 of the remaining new cases are linked to previous patients or community infection clusters, according to a Ministry of Health news release.
Fifteen of the new infections are currently unlinked and contact tracing is ongoing.
Overall, there have been 1,049 recorded cases of the novel coronavirus in Singapore since the outbreak began.
Like many other Asian countries, Singapore is currently experiencing a second wave of infections after bringing its initial outbreak more or less under control.
As of April 3, 266 confirmed coronavirus patients have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals and community isolation facilities across Singapore.
Of the 779 cases still being treated in hospitals across the city, 23 are in critical condition.
Four cases have died from complications due to the coronavirus according to the Ministry of Health.
CNN’s Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta's two-hour special on the coronavirus pandemic has concluded.
Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, recently purchased 1.2 million N95 protective masks to donate to the state of Massachusetts and another 300,000 for New York state.
He joined CNN's coronavirus town hall to explain how it got done.
Kraft explained that his eldest son, who is the chairman of the board of Massachusetts General Hospital, is close with the state's governor, Charlie Baker.
Baker asked if there was a way that the state could get the masks bought in China.
So Kraft offered to use the team's jet, which was sitting idle.
Kraft said he believes both Baker and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was on CNN at the time, were both doing a great job.
Gov. Cuomo said the call he got from Kraft saying they were getting the extra masks was probably ""the only good call I've gotten in about 10 days."" Japan reported 235 new cases of the novel coronavirus today, bringing the total number of recorded cases in the country to 3,329.
The East Asian country also reported three new coronavirus-related deaths.
Tokyo had its largest single-day rise yet, with 97 new cases.
The number of cases reported in the capital is now 684.
Japan’s national total includes 2,617 cases on land and 712 related to the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined in Yokohama Bay for two weeks in February.
A total of 74 people have died from Covid-19 in Japan, including 63 on land and 11 related to the Diamond Princess.
Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead for the World Health Organization's Covid-19 response, chimed in on the current debate about when to wear face masks and who should be wearing them.
""What we recommend is that people who are sick wear masks -- medical masks, not N95 masks with respirators.
Those must be reserved for our frontline workers who are caring for patients,"" she said.
""We also need people who are caring for those who are sick to be wearing the masks,"" she said.
She said right now, it's crucial that personal protective equipment in short supply be reserved for medical workers.
The WHO has been one of the strongest holdouts when it comes to recommending the widespread use of masks.
US health officials recommended the same, but may be shifting course.
On Monday, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Redfield, told NPR that his organization was reviewing its guidelines and may recommend general mask use to guard against community infection.
Trump said the US plans to release new recommendations on face masks in the coming days.
When asked about President Trump's suggestion that people use facial coverings like scarves, Van Kerkhove said the WHO is investigating.
""We are constantly looking at evidence, all the time, for the use of masks for anything that is related to this and related to health issues.
We are talking with scientists around the world, including US CDC scientists,"" she said.
Dr. Leana Wen, the former Baltimore health commissioner, said currently there is no evidence that the coronavirus can spread long distances.
However, she added that the virus could spread through a defective plumbing system.
At the Amoy Gardens housing estate, there were more than 300 infections and 42 deaths after defective plumbing allowed the virus to spread through the building.
Dr. Wen also recommended opening the windows to increase your own ventilation once the weather gets warmer and to wash your hands thoroughly after touching surfaces that are used often, like handrails or buttons in elevators.
Peru will allow men and women out on separate days as part of a gender-based quarantine measure designed to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country.
The new measures will begin in Peru today, President Martin Vizcarra announced to the nation on Thursday.
So far, Peru has reported 1,414 cases of coronavirus and 55 deaths.
It comes two days after Panama began restricting movement by gender, arguing the measure urges people to return home since their loves ones are not allowed to be outside.
Peru said it would adopt the same system following the positive results the gender-based measure has yielded in other countries and due to its simplicity in visually detecting who should and shouldn't be out on the streets, Vizcarra explained.

Previously, patients had to have a negative test from their discharging hospital before being admitted on to the ship.
The change in procedure was done in an effort to bring more patients aboard the USNS Comfort.
Patients who are brought aboard the ship without symptoms of Covid-19 will be isolated and tested upon arrival.

President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence both stumbled over medical details, and spread inaccurate information, while touting new coronavirus tests and potential treatments.
Trump mentioned anti-malaria drugs that are being tested as potential treatments, saying that the clinical trials are “having some good results,” even though public health officials say the results are months away.
Moments later, Vice President Mike Pence said the Food and Drug Administration had “approved” a new method to test the coronavirus, even though the FDA only granted emergency authorization for the test, which requires a much lower standard.
Facts First: Both comments overstate the medical realities a bit.
For Trump, he has repeatedly touted and expressed unbridled optimism about the drugs, even without conclusive scientific data to back up his claims.
For Pence, he oversold the FDA’s confidence in the new Covid-19 test.
In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly touted two pharmaceuticals, chloroquine and the chemically similar hydroxychloroquine, as potential “game-changers” that could end the pandemic and save lives.
Trump has breathlessly promoted the drugs while the public health officials are cautiously waiting for scientific evidence, and tamping down expectations, by saying that the information out there already is only anecdotal and not proven on a large-scale.
Later in the press conference, Pence brought up the new blood test for coronavirus antibodies.
“And the big news, of course, over the last few days was that the FDA, once again, in near record time, has approved an antibody test developed by Cellex,” Pence said.
The FDA uses very specific terminology about medical drugs, tests and equipment, and the FDA would likely disagree with the notion that it “approved” the test.
These terms are important, as medical professionals need clarity to be sure their use of these items is safe for every patient.
What really happened was that the FDA granted “emergency use authorization” for the tests.
This essentially means that the FDA will let health care providers use the tests during this crisis, even though it hasn’t gone through all the steps that medicines and medical tests usually go through before receiving a full “approval."" President Trump said Friday that he could not assure the state of New York will have enough ventilators to deal with coronavirus patients, after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state is days away from running out of the lifesaving machines.
Asked during a White House press briefing whether he could assure that the state would have enough ventilators, Trump said, “No, they should have had more ventilators at the time.” Trump added that the White House thinks Cuomo is “well served with ventilators.
We’re going to find out, but we have other states to take care of.” “I wish they did the original orders (for ventilators) three years ago.
They would have had all the ventilators they needed,” Trump continued, before adding, “Although, even then they wouldn’t.” Some context: On Monday, Trump told reporters that he thinks every American who may need a ventilator in the next few weeks will have access to one.

President Donald Trump continued to claim hydroxychloroquine has high efficacy against Covid-19, stating lupus patients – who are commonly treated with hydroxychloroquine – are less likely to contract the virus on Saturday at a White House press briefing.
However, there is no ""definitive information to be able to make any comment,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, at the briefing.
The relationship between lupus and Covid-19 is currently being studied in ""a natural history study,"" Fauci said.
Trump later stated he would take the medication, likely as a preventative measure, given his negative Covid-19 testing.
""But I think people should [take hydroxychloroquine],"" he said.
But I may take it."" There are currently no products approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent Covid-19.
Nichole Francis Reynolds was out with her children and their friend, Storm Quinn, Friday picking up dinner in upper northwest Washington, DC, when she ran into Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Francis Reynolds told CNN she, her son Clark and daughter Stella Grace recognized Fauci and approached him, asking for a photograph.
Fauci agreed to the photo, but only if they followed social distancing guidelines, meaning they'd have to stand at least 6 feet from each other, Francis Reynolds said.
The group ended up taking what Francis Reynolds called a ""social distancing selfie."" ""I thought that he was very pleasant.

A third passenger from the Coral Princess cruise ship has died after being transported by a private ambulance to a hospital in Hialeah, Florida, according to a press release from the office of Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez.
The Coral Princess departed Santiago, Chile, on March 5.
Princess Cruises announced operations were halting one week later.
On Saturday, Princess Cruises confirmed the ship arrived in Miami, Florida.
The cruise line said Saturday that disembarkation of guests is expected to take several days due to limited flight availability and passengers ""requiring shoreside medical care will be prioritized to disembark first."" Two passengers died on board the ship before it docked and six others were transported from the ship for treatment at local hospitals on Saturday, the release from Gimenez's office said.
Eight additional passengers were transported from the Coral Princess to local hospitals on Sunday, according to the release.
The county is not able to clear passengers to leave the ship, the release said.
Vessels are required to report to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Customs and Border Protection and the US Coast Guard, to have their passengers offloaded, the release said.
Passengers and crew who have received medical screenings and clearance for travel are driven on charter buses to an isolated area of Miami International Airport and go directly to board charter flights coordinated by the cruise line, the release said.
Gimenez sent additional medical staff to assist the Coral Princess Sunday, the release said.
The county also replaced the ship's oxygen cylinders with full ones after learning the supply on board was critically low, the release said.
President Donald Trump said he would wear a face mask if he ""thought it was important."" Trump was asked at the White House briefing Sunday about his wife Melania Trump, who for days has tweeted encouraging the use of masks.
""She likes the idea of wearing it,"" Trump said, ""A lot of people do."" Trump said he would wear one.
""I'm just generally not in a, like, I should, would you like me to wear one right now in answering your question?
That would be a little awkward I guess."" ""I would wear one if I thought it was important,"" he said.
Asked if his family in New York would start wearing masks and if he was encouraging them to wear them, Trump answered: ""Wouldn’t be surprised."" Dr. Anthony Fauci said he tested negative for coronavirus Saturday when asked why he wasn't wearing a face mask.
""The major reason to wear a face mask is to protect you from infecting you,"" Fauci said.
""I had my test yesterday and it’s negative."" President Trump added: ""Very good answer."" At one New York hospital emergency room, six patients went into cardiac arrest in a span of 40 minutes.
""They're talking to you and then a few minutes later you're putting a tube down their throat and you're hoping that you can set the ventilator in such a way that it actually helps them."" This is the truth of what coronavirus is doing to thousands of Americans, and likely will to many thousand more.
It has been largely unseen because visitors are not allowed to be in hospitals, and everyone else is staying home.
CNN was invited to witness the scenes inside the University Hospital of Brooklyn, New York, part of the SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University.
All the patients the hospital treats now are suffering from coronavirus.
The hospital is one of three in the state ordered by Gov. Andrew Cuomo to dedicate itself entirely to dealing with the pandemic.
Hydroxychloroquine will be used in a trial of 3,000 patients at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, and the results will be tracked in a formal study, Vice President Mike Pence announced Sunday.
Pence added that they are ""more than prepared"" to make hydroxychloroquine available to doctor's offices and pharmacies in the Detroit area ""as they deem appropriate."" Rear Adm. John Polowczyk of the Supply Chain Logistics Task Force said that the government is working to put out millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine into areas with increasing number of coronavirus cases.
President Donald Trump has frequently claimed the drug has high efficacy against Covid-19 despite no evidence the drug is effective and safe for preventing or treating the coronavirus.
However, there is no ""definitive information to be able to make any comment"" on whether the drug can be used to treat coronavirus, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, at the White House briefing on Saturday.

The Department of Veterans Affairs will open about 1,500 beds at hospitals in multiple states to civilians to alleviate the burden on civilian hospitals, according VA Secretary Robert Wilkie.
""We provide a bridge from the federal government to states and localities during these emergencies,"" Wilkie said.
In the metropolitan New York area, the VA is opening up approximately 100 beds in Brooklyn, Manhattan and East Orange in New Jersey, Wilkie said.
Louisiana will gain access to the VA medical center in Shreveport, Wilkie said.
In Michigan, access to hospital beds will be provided in both Ann Arbor and Detroit as as providing a pharmaceutical trailer for the state's use, Wilkie said.
Wilkie said the VA will help Massachusetts officials ""in their efforts to protect the most vulnerable citizens in two of their nursing homes."" President Donald Trump showed optimism during a press briefing Sunday evening about the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Colombian President Iván Duque announced that he will extend the nationwide isolation order until April 26.
In a tweet, Duque said the measures taken to slow the spread of coronavirus ""have been positive.” The order for “mandatory preventive isolation” took effect on March 25 and was initially scheduled until April 13.
All 10 million residents in Los Angeles County are now eligible to apply for a coronavirus test.
Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a news conference today that there are “no longer any limits” on who can apply for the testing.
Garcetti said that doesn’t mean officials immediately have a test for everyone in the county -- the most populous in the US -- but it means that the capacity of tests is now greater than the number of cases they’ve been receiving under the previous guidelines.
LA County residents can register for testing at https://corona-virus.la If North Carolina stops social distancing at the end of April -- as President Donald Trump and administration officials have pushed for -- there could be 750,000 state residents infected by June, said state health officials.
The North Carolina-specific modeling forecast showed that if the state stopped social distancing by the end of this month, there is more than a 50% probability that the state will outstrip ICU bed capability and acute care capacity -- even as early as May. On the other hand, if social distancing stayed in effect, it could cut the number of infections by half a million cases -- down to 250,000.
North Carolina now has 2,870 cases and 33 deaths, said Cohen.
Chile has announced the mandatory use of face masks for all travelers riding public and private transportation to combat the spread of coronavirus.
During a televised press conference Monday, Chile's Undersecretary of Public Health Paula Daza said the measure will go in effect Wednesday, April 8 at 5 am local time.
Some of the transportation methods that are included in the measure include trains, buses, metros and taxis.
The announcement comes after Health Minister Jaime Mañalich called on the population to start making their own masks with homemade materials, such as T-shirts and scarves.
California's Judicial Council approved a series of temporary emergency rules Monday, including staying eviction and foreclosure proceedings during the Covid-19 pandemic, a vote that reinforces Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's executive order to delay such actions against renters and homeowners in the state.
During a teleconference Monday afternoon, the council also moved to set bail statewide at $0 for misdemeanors and lower-level felonies to ""safely reduce jail populations."" Chief Justice Tani G.
Cantil-Sakauye opened the session saying, ""(We are) trying our best to preserve rights and ultimately preserve lives."" ""We are at this point truly with no guidance in either history, law or precedent.
And to say that there is no playbook is a gross understatement of the situation."" District attorney Jackie Lacey, who presides over Los Angeles County where a zero-bail measure was implemented last week to reduce the number of inmates, applauded the decision.
""I appreciate the collaboration among criminal justice leaders in Los Angeles County that has resulted in the rapid deployment of new and innovative approaches as we work to try to stop the spread of COVID-19 in our community,"" Lacey said in a statement.
In total the council approved 11 temporary emergency rules.
Among the actions the council approved, to go into effect immediately are: During Monday's White House coronavirus task force briefing, Trump claimed that the Paycheck Protection Program -- a small businesses lending program -- has “really been performing well.” Trump said there were a few “minor glitches that have already been taken care of.” Facts First: CNN has reported significant issues to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), with system wide failures as lenders process these loans.
Days after the launch of the Small Business Administration's rollout of the PPP, there are still delays in the system lenders use to upload loan application information and the money is still largely not going out to the businesses that need it yet.
According to an industry source who spoke to CNN, major system-wide failures continue to crop up in the PPP system, including shutdowns preventing the submission of applications from lenders on their system known as E-Tran.
These issues have slowed down the ability for banks to participate in the loan program, this source tells CNN.
Additionally, several bank executives tell CNN they want the Treasury Department or the Small Business Administration to offer more guidance on how they are supposed to disburse funds.
CNN reporting indicates there are also concerns among lenders who say they won’t cut checks until there is clear guidance on how they should distribute the money.

The small study was published Monday in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and looked at data from 43 pregnant women in New York who tested positive for Covid-19 over two weeks between March 13 and 27.
Thirty-seven of the women in the study experienced a mild form of Covid-19, four developed a severe form of the disease and two experienced what researchers called “critical disease.” The percentages are similar to the breakdown of severity in disease in the general population.
About 80% experience mild disease, 15% develop severe cases and 5% result in critical cases.
Scientists were interested in the impact of the disease on pregnant women because in prior SARS and H1N1 pandemics, pregnant women were more susceptible to serious forms of the illness and had a greater chance of dying from the infection than the general population.
None of the babies in this study seemed to be infected, based on tests performed on them on the first day of their lives.
Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, says she did not visit her grandchild despite the 10-month-old having “a fever of 105 this weekend.” Birx shared her experience during a Monday task force briefing with reporters, while urging people in particularly high-risk areas to stay home as much as possible.
And I couldn’t get there,” she said during the press briefing.
“I mean, so I’m trying to explain to my daughter how to listen to her lungs.

“I mean, you can’t take that kind of risk with the leaders of the country.” Birx said that her granddaughter is “coming out of it.” She stopped short of telling people not to go to the grocery store for the next week in high-risk areas, but did recommend consolidating shopping trips and sending one member per family.",2020-04-05,"['isolation', 'order', 'measure', 'order', 'isolation', 'effect', 'schedule', 'resident', 'test', 'news', 'conference', 'today', 'testing', 'test', 'capacity', 'test', 'number', 'case', 'resident', 'testing', 'end', 'administration', 'push', 'state', 'resident', 'state', 'health', 'forecast', 'state', 'end', 'month', 'probability', 'state', 'bed', 'capability', 'care', 'capacity', 'hand', 'effect', 'number', 'infection', 'half', 'case', 'case', 'death', 'use', 'face', 'traveler', 'transportation', 'combat', 'televise', 'press', 'conference', 'health', 'measure', 'effect', 'time', 'transportation', 'measure', 'train', 'bus', 'taxi', 'announcement', 'health', 'call', 'population', 'material', 'shirt', 'scarf', 'emergency', 'rule', 'eviction', 'foreclosure', 'vote', 'order', 'action', 'state', 'afternoon', 'set', 'bail', 'level', 'jail', 'population', 'session', 'life', 'point', 'guidance', 'history', 'law', 'precedent', 'understatement', 'situation', 'district', 'attorney', 'lacey', 'bail', 'measure', 'week', 'number', 'decision', 'collaboration', 'leader', 'result', 'deployment', 'work', 'community', 'lacey', 'statement', 'emergency', 'rule', 'action', 'effect', 'task', 'force', 'briefing', 'claim', 'protection', 'program', 'business', 'lending', 'program', 'glitch', 'care', 'fact', 'report', 'issue', 'protection', 'program', 'system', 'failure', 'process', 'loan', 'day', 'launch', 'business', 'administration', 'system', 'use', 'loan', 'application', 'information', 'money', 'business', 'industry', 'source', 'system', 'failure', 'crop', 'system', 'submission', 'application', 'system', 'issue', 'ability', 'bank', 'loan', 'program', 'source', 'bank', 'business', 'administration', 'offer', 'guidance', 'concern', 'guidance', 'money', 'glitch', 'business', 'lending', 'program', 'study', 'obstetrics', 'gynecology', 'woman', 'test', 'week', 'woman', 'study', 'experience', 'form', 'form', 'experience', 'researcher', 'call', 'percentage', 'breakdown', 'severity', 'population', 'experience', 'case', 'result', 'case', 'scientist', 'impact', 'woman', 'woman', 'form', 'chance', 'infection', 'population', 'none', 'baby', 'study', 'test', 'day', 'life', 'coordinator', 'task', 'force', 'weekend', 'share', 'experience', 'task', 'force', 'reporter', 'people', 'risk', 'area', 'home', 'press', 'briefing', 'daughter', 'gesture', 'risk', 'leader', 'country', 'granddaughter', 'people', 'grocery', 'store', 'week', 'risk', 'area', 'shopping', 'trip', 'member', 'family']"

In a brief statement released Tuesday, Beijing authorities said Ren Zhiqiang, a real estate tycoon with close ties to senior Chinese officials, has been placed under investigation for alleged ""serious violations"" of laws and Communist Party regulations.
After allegedly penning a scathing article on President Xi Jinping's handling of the coronavirus crisis, he reportedly disappeared last month with rumors swirling about his detention by the authorities.
People who test positive for the coronavirus and die at home will be included in New York City’s case count, according to authorities.
New York city has reported a total of 3,544 deaths and a total of 74,601 coronavirus cases to date.
New York state currently has 139,875 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including 5,489 deaths.
The United States' coronavirus death toll reached 12,722 on Tuesday evening, with an increase of 1,736 deaths during the day.
That number marks the most deaths recorded in a single day so far.
According to data supplied by Johns Hopkins University, the previous record for the most new US coronavirus deaths added in a single day was 1,344.
President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that he knows ""for a fact"" that the United States doesn’t actually have the highest number of coronavirus cases in the world, saying it's simply testing more than any other country -- a comment the coordinator of his White House coronavirus task force later clarified.
""I think the reporting here has been pretty straight-forward for the past five – six weeks,"" Dr. Deborah Birx told reporters.
""Prior to that, when there wasn’t testing in January and February, that’s a very different situation and unknown.” Earlier in the press conference, Trump said that ""America continues to perform more tests than any other nation in the world, and I think that’s probably why we have more cases."" ""Because you look at some these very large countries,"" he continued, ""I know for a fact that they have far more cases than we do, but they don’t report them."" Per capita, countries like Italy and South Korea have done more testing than the United States by far.
Many experts believe that the number of coronavirus cases in the US is likely higher than reported due to problems with testing availability.
Birx elaborated there may have been early deaths in the US that were not counted as coronavirus related, but perhaps should have been.
Birx said some countries don’t consider coronavirus to be the cause of death in some individuals with pre-existing conditions.
“There are other countries that if you had a pre-existing condition, and let’s say the virus caused you to go to the ICU and then have a heart or kidney problem, some countries are recording that as a heart issue or a kidney issue and not a Covid-19 death.” “The intent is right now,” she said, “if someone dies with Covid-19, we are counting that as a Covid-19 death.” She later conceded that some rural areas might not “have the same level of testing.” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he is worried about coronavirus cases and hospitalizations increasing again as some people start to leave their homes.
People have been in their homes for one month, everyone has cabin fever and they're coming out in greater numbers,"" Cuomo told CNN's Erin Burnett.
Earlier Tuesday, Cuomo said at his daily press briefing that hospitalizations may be leveling off and social distancing ""is working,"" but stressed that New Yorkers need to keep doing it.
He told Burnett his focus isn't merely on preventing a second wave, but working to improve the current situation in New York -- an epicenter for coronavirus in the United States.
""(I'm) not even worried about a second wave.
I'm worried about getting out of the situation we're in right now and saving as many lives as possible and that will be a direct coefficient of how well we comply with social distancing,"" Cuomo said.
The governor said not complying with social distancing would be irresponsible and put a burden on health care workers and first responders.
""This really is a time where your own individual actions affect other people.
It can literally kill other people,"" he said.
There are at least 387,547 cases of coronavirus in the United States and at least 12,291 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases.
So far Tuesday, there are at least 19,351 new cases and 1,305 deaths have been reported, according to the tally.

President Donald Trump said he didn’t see the coronavirus warning memos written by his trade adviser Peter Navarro in January until a “day or two” ago, telling reporters Tuesday: “I didn’t see them.
I didn’t look for them either.” A source familiar with the memo confirmed to CNN that Navarro fired off an internal memo in January warning the coronavirus could become a ""full-blown pandemic,"" risking trillions of dollars in economic losses and the health of millions.

Outdoor meeting places used for recreation in Nevada will be closed until further notice in order to curb the spread of Covid-19, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Thursday.
Sisolak said people can continue to play sports on their own private property.
Additionally, as most Christian denominations begin to celebrate the Easter week, Sisolak is prohibiting public worship services, except those that can be done with no more than 10 people.
The new Nevada orders also close retail showrooms for businesses like car dealerships and furniture stores.
Sisolak said these areas “encourage customers to wander around and touch products, and that sort of shopping experience can lead to a higher likelihood of spreading the disease.” Although grocery stores can continue to operate as essential businesses, they can no longer sell food on open display, such as salad bars, bulk candy and freshly-ground coffee.

New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu expressed his frustration with obtaining crucial medical supplies from the federal government during a press conference in Concord on Wednesday.
The state received 15 Abbott rapid-testing devices last week, as part of the Granite State’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Sununu.
However, the Republican governor said they received only a limited number of the cartridges required to perform the tests, and a portion of those must be used for training and calibration purposes.
Sununu hoped to stock two machines with cartridges and get them into the field “fairly quickly,” but when the state requested additional cartridges for the remaining 13 machines, he was told to expect approximately 15% of his requested cartridges.
Sununu also said he doesn’t know when to expect that portion of cartridges.
“It’s incredibly frustrating because there's a lot of talk about this device, there was a lot of hype on it nationally, how it was it wonderful, and when they showed up, expectations were set really high, as they should be,” the governor said.
It’s really frustrating.” Ahead of Passover and Easter, the Department of Homeland Security warned the faith-based community about an ""increase in online hate speech intended to encourage violence"" or use the ongoing coronavirus pandemic situation as an excuse to spread hatred.
In a letter to community members Wednesday, the department reminded��houses of worship to review security plans and procedures ahead of congregant gatherings, acknowledging that many people are worshipping remotely at this time.
""[T]here has been an increase in online hate speech intended to encourage violence or use the ongoing situation as an excuse to spread hatred,"" read the letter from the department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, obtained by CNN.
Additionally, stressors caused by the pandemic may contribute to an individual’s decision to commit an attack or influence their target of choice, according to DHS.
The letter is aimed at providing the faith community with guidance for planning of ""restoration of normal operations, whenever that may be."" Some context: Officials at DHS have been grappling with how to address concerns about targeted violence amid the ongoing health crisis.
The department is trying to balance resources needed to respond to Covid-19 across the country and the need to remind people to be vigilant of potential violence, a DHS official said.
Social distancing creates opportunity to become isolated, more glued to the TV and computer and less social engagement, said the official, adding ""no doubt we are all experiencing stress."" Officials are concerned that someone who is already vulnerable could easily be recruited by violent ideologies or that the situation becomes precursor to them carrying out attack.
In addition, the department is aware of individuals using Covid-19 to propagate conspiracy theories, said the official.
A prestigious scientific panel told the White House on Tuesday that it doesn't look coronavirus will go away once the weather warms up.
President Donald Trump has claimed that ""when it gets a little warmer [the virus] miraculously goes away."" In their letter to the White House, members of a National Academy of Sciences committee said data is mixed on whether coronavirus spreads as easily in warm weather as it does in cold weather, but that it might not matter much given that so few people in the world are immune to coronavirus.
The letter noted, for example, that a study of the outbreak in China showed that even under maximum temperature and humidity conditions, the virus spread ""exponentially,"" with every infected person spreading it to nearly two other people on average.
The scientists sent the letter to Kelvin Droegemeier at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
The letter from the NAS scientists notes that some laboratory studies have shown reduced transmission of the virus under warmer and more humid conditions, but that it's still a concern.
The letter points out that in the real world, the virus is still transmitting in countries with warm weather.
""Given that countries currently in 'summer' climates, such as Australia and Iran, are experiencing rapid virus spread, a decrease in cases with increases in humidity and temperature elsewhere should not be assumed,"" the letter said.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield issued new guidelines for essential workers who have been exposed to the coronavirus, saying individuals would need to be asymptomatic to return to work The guidelines, he said, are aimed at keeping essential workers including first responders, health care workers, employees in the food supply chain and others at work -- even if they might have been exposed to someone who has coronavirus.
“These are individuals that have been within six feet of a confirmed case or a suspected case so that they can, under certain circumstances, they can go back to work if they are asymptomatic,” Redfield said.
Redfield said those individuals could return to work if they take their temperature before work, wear a face mask at all times and practice social distancing at work.
He reiterated that individuals should stay home if they feel sick, they should not share items used on or near their face and they should refrain from congregating in break rooms and other crowded places.
The CDC’s new guidelines also outlined steps employers should take, including checking temperatures before employees start work, sending anyone who becomes sick home and cleaning commonly touched surfaces more frequently, among others.",2020-04-07,"['meeting', 'place', 'use', 'recreation', 'notice', 'order', 'curb', 'people', 'property', 'denomination', 'week', 'worship', 'service', 'people', 'order', 'business', 'car', 'dealership', 'furniture', 'store', 'area', 'customer', 'product', 'shopping', 'experience', 'grocery', 'store', 'business', 'food', 'display', 'salad', 'bar', 'candy', 'ground', 'coffee', 'state', 'trend', 'direction', 'news', 'conference', 'case', 'state', 'test', 'yesterday', 'testing', 'testing', 'site', 'today', 'lack', 'test', 'kit', 'supply', 'shipment', 'today', 'case', 'jail', 'jail', 'source', 'infection', 'facility', 'office', 'detainee', 'staff', 'member', 'test', 'virus', 'detainee', 'treatment', 'recovery', 'facility', 'detainee', 'complication', 'jail', 'detainee', 'rest', 'jail', 'population', 'jail', 'detainee', 'office', 'jail', 'plan', 'screen', 'release', 'defendant', 'behalf', 'family', 'meal', 'seafood', 'restaurant', 'feed', 'health', 'care', 'worker', 'health', 'system', 'frustration', 'supply', 'government', 'press', 'conference', 'state', 'testing', 'device', 'week', 'part', 'state', 'response', 'number', 'test', 'portion', 'use', 'training', 'calibration', 'purpose', 'stock', 'machine', 'field', 'state', 'machine', 'portion', 'lot', 'talk', 'device', 'lot', 'expectation', 'set', 'security', 'faith', 'community', 'increase', 'speech', 'violence', 'use', 'situation', 'letter', 'community', 'member', 'worship', 'security', 'plan', 'procedure', 'gathering', 'people', 'worship', 'time', 'increase', 'speech', 'violence', 'use', 'situation', 'letter', 'cybersecurity', 'infrastructure', 'security', 'decision', 'attack', 'influence', 'target', 'choice', 'letter', 'faith', 'community', 'guidance', 'planning', 'restoration', 'operation', 'context', 'address', 'concern', 'target', 'violence', 'health', 'crisis', 'balance', 'resource', 'country', 'people', 'violence', 'opportunity', 'tv', 'computer', 'engagement', 'doubt', 'experience', 'stress', 'ideology', 'situation', 'attack', 'addition', 'use', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'panel', 'weather', 'claim', 'virus', 'letter', 'member', 'sciences', 'data', 'weather', 'weather', 'people', 'world', 'letter', 'example', 'study', 'temperature', 'humidity', 'condition', 'virus', 'person', 'people', 'scientist', 'letter', 'office', 'science', 'technology', 'policy', 'letter', 'scientist', 'study', 'transmission', 'virus', 'condition', 'concern', 'letter', 'point', 'world', 'virus', 'transmit', 'country', 'weather', 'country', 'summer', 'climate', 'experience', 'virus', 'case', 'increase', 'humidity', 'temperature', 'letter', 'centers', 'director', 'issue', 'worker', 'return', 'work', 'worker', 'health', 'care', 'worker', 'employee', 'food', 'supply', 'chain', 'work', 'foot', 'case', 'case', 'circumstance', 'work', 'return', 'work', 'temperature', 'work', 'face', 'time', 'practice', 'work', 'home', 'share', 'item', 'use', 'face', 'room', 'place', 'step', 'temperature', 'employee', 'work', 'home', 'surface']"

Alaska is the latest state to extend school closures through the remainder of the academic year.
To wait another two or three weeks when we’re already close to the (end of the) school year at that point, we feel would cause more disruption and more confusion,” said Gov. Mike Dunleavy in a press conference today.
The state is also extending its social distancing order for another ten days, effective through at least April 21.
“We wanted to make sure we continue that we continue the good work that all Alaskans are doing,"" said Health and Social Services Commissioner Adam Crum.
Coronavirus cases in Europe are doubling very rapidly, every three to four days, said the World Health Organization’s Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove on CNN’s coronavirus town hall tonight.
Experts identify the number of cases being reported each day and how quickly those numbers are doubling -- and this rate is called the doubling time, she said.
""Right now, across Europe the doubling time is three to four days.
That's very fast,” Van Kerkhove said.
She also expressed the importance of testing to determine the global spread of the outbreak.
""If you're seeing countries that have 30% positivity rate, that means that there's a lot of cases that are out there.
If you're seeing countries that have a 1% positivity rate, that means ...
they're actually capturing more of their cases,” Van Kerkhove said.
A positivity rate means the percentage of positive results out of total tests done.
Twenty five more detainees at the Cook County Jail in Chicago have tested positive for Covid-19, raising the total number of cases among inmates to 276, said the Cook County Sheriff’s Office today.
Of these infected detainees, 21 have been hospitalized and 36 have been moved to a recovery facility.
172 employees at the county sheriff’s office also tested positive, with the majority of employees being correctional deputies at the jail.
Releasing detainees: The sheriff’s office said today that they will continue help identify individuals for release.
This process has already reduced the jail population by 1,247 detainees since March 9.
But also today, a federal judge denied a motion to order the immediate release of medically vulnerable detainees at the jail to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
Instead, here's what they're doing: There will be a mobile testing site at the jail for sheriff's office staff, capable of testing up to 100 people a day, said Sheriff Thomas Dart.
Jail officials say they have moved inmates from double cells to single cells to increase social distancing, and have created an off-site 500-bed quarantine and care facility for detainees.
New York City has 7,521 new coronavirus cases and 518 new deaths, according to the city’s website.
That brings the city's total to 87,725 cases and 4,778 deaths.
This case total doesn't reflect the number of active cases, but rather the total number of people infected since the start of the pandemic.
That means, according to official statistics, New York City alone now has had more infections than the whole of China, which has reported 81,907 cases, according to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Former Los Angeles Laker player and NBA Hall of Fame point guard Magic Johnson joined CNN's coronavirus town hall to talk about his experience living through two major outbreaks -- the HIV epidemic and now this pandemic.
""When you think about African-Americans, we deal with a lot of health issues already.
And then the lack of access to health care, that's just an unbeatable combination, and so we must get better,"" he said.
Change must begin at a local level, then at a state level, then at the federal level, he said.
""Until someone says, hey, we're going to make sure that African-Americans and Latinos and others have a level playing field, that the same opportunities that others have ...
Until those things change, (minorities) are still going to have a lack of health care."" Johnson announced in 1991 both his retirement from the NBA -- and his HIV-positive status.
""I think right now is similar to what happened with HIV and AIDS,"" he said.
Some of those parallels include a lack of testing in black and minority communities, and a lack of accurate information within underprivileged areas, he said.
Louisiana Rep. Reggie Bagala has died from the coronavirus after being hospitalized, his son said today.
Lafourche Parish Sheriff's Office spokesman, Brennan Matherne, confirmed that Bagala passed away from Covid-19.
Bagala, 54, was a Republican freshman who represented the Jefferson and Lafourche parishes, and was elected to office in 2019.
Earlier this week, he had said on Facebook that his father was in ""seriously critical condition” at Ochsner St. Anne Hospital in Raceland, southwest of New Orleans.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards also paid tribute to Bagala.
“Just one month ago, he entered the Louisiana State Capitol with excitement and eagerness to serve the people of our great state and the people of House District 54, and today we mourn his loss.
We are better for having people like Rep. Bagala who are willing to be public servants & make our state better,” Edwards said on Twitter.
At the ongoing CNN town hall on coronavirus facts and fears, medical experts and officials answered questions from the audience.
Here are a few: ""The data that we have now clearly does show that minority populations appear to be having a greater risk for complications,"" said US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield.
The virus ""does not discriminate who it infects"" -- but racial minorities including African Americans are at higher risk of complication because of health disparities.
It's too early to tell, Redfield said -- there are clinical trials underway on this, but we just don't have the data yet to tell what's effective or not.
""At this stage, this moment in time, we're not recommending it, but we're not not recommending it,"" he said.
""The way to do this is to do the appropriate trials and get the answer.""

A federal judge is declining to order the immediate release of thousands of inmates in Illinois due to concerns over potential exposure to coronavirus.
Judge Robert Dow says civil rights advocates who filed suit against the state Department of Corrections and Gov. J.B. Pritzker did not show that a mass release was the only reasonable response.
Although Dow is keeping the case open – and encouraged state officials to work their hardest to preserve the health of prisoners – he refused to order the state to release, by his estimate, “at least 12,000 inmates, almost one-third of the prison population in Illinois.” Nashville Metro Public Health Department is investigating a possible cluster of coronavirus cases at the Tyson Foods plant in Goodlettsville, according to an email from Metro Public Health Department Public Information officer Brian Todd.
Todd told CNN in a statement that no further information regarding the investigation or number of cases could be released at this time.
When asked if the state of Maryland is running low on coronavirus testing kits, Charles Gischlar, the deputy director of the Maryland Department of Health, said ""there are still testing challenges occurring in the state, although private labs and medical facilities have ramped up testing.” The Maryland Department of Health Lab can process about 500 tests a day and process priority group Covid-19 tests seven days a week.
In accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, priority groups for testing are symptomatic health care workers and first responders; symptomatic people over age 65 and those who live in nursing homes and other types of group housing; and those who are symptomatic and medically unstable for whom their health care provider has determined a test is necessary to manage their medical condition, Gischlar said.
The USNS Mercy, currently docked at the Port of Los Angeles, will now take seniors from nursing homes that have not tested positive for the coronavirus, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced in a press conference on Friday.
Using the USNS Mercy for non-coronavirus patients will help “help decompress the system,” Newsom said.
Today’s press conference heavily focused on the importance of prioritizing the vulnerable senior population.
“Skilled nursing facilities continue to be top priority of our efforts,” Newsom said.
By the numbers: The state is currently monitoring 191 skilled nursing facilities where 1,266 individuals, both staff and residents, have been infected.
An additional 94 licensed facilities are being monitored with 370 patients and staff infected.
There are a total of 1,224 nursing homes and 7,461 licensed facilities throughout the Department of Social Services, according to Newsom.
Infections control professionals are working with the CDC and others to saturate areas of concerns.
600 nurses have been trained to support the regulatory system, Newsom said.
In addition, the state is also focusing on providing technical guidance.

""At this challenging time, the public has a continuing and growing need for legal services in many critical areas,"" Rabner stated in the order Monday.
“Newly admitted lawyers can help meet that need.” The graduates must apply to take the first exam scheduled after graduation, or qualify for an extension, and must also earn certification from the Supreme Court Committee on Character before they can practice.
""The temporary ability to practice law will lapse if the graduate does not sit for the first bar exam scheduled after graduation, unless granted an extension, or if the graduate does not pass the exam,"" the release said.
Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has asked FEMA to begin the development of a second alternative care facility to prepare for a potential surge in Covid-19 cases, Evers said in a statement.
The facility would be housed in the Alliant Energy Center, a large multi-venue complex in Madison.
""Dane County is proud to partner with Governor Evers and make our facility available to the state,"" says Dane County Executive Joe Parisi, who oversees the space.
""This second alternative care facility will be an essential backup facility to ensure our healthcare system in the south central region is not overwhelmed,"" Evers said.
""Hopefully this second site will not be needed, but we must prepare for it now so we are ready."" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected the resignation submitted by Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu after the minister came under heavy criticism for his implementation of a surprise lockdown in Turkey.
In a written statement about his resignation, Soylu said the scenes created after the lockdown announcement did not fit into the ""perfectly managed process"" by the government against the spread of Covid-19.
After the announcement of the curfew, people rushed out to markets to stock up on goods before the start of the lockdown leading to close contact between people.
In his statement, Soylu took near complete blame for the chaos and asked for ""forgiveness from my dear nation, which I have never wanted to harm, and my president to whom I will be loyal till the end of my life."" The offer of resignation was submitted to the president and was rejected, according to a written statement by the Turkish presidency.
""The decision to offer a resignation rests with the office holder but to accept it is the decision of the President.
The resignation has not been accepted and the minister will continue his post,"" the statement said.
The statement praised Soylu's past performance across a wide range of policy issues as well as more recently on the Covid-19 measures.
As he promised, Idaho rancher Ammon Bundy – who once led an armed occupation of federal land in Oregon – organized an Easter Sunday church service in violation of a statewide order on mass gatherings.
A livestream of the service showed dozens of people in folding chairs sitting together in Bundy’s industrial warehouse in the small city of Emmett, about 30 miles northwest of Boise, where a handmade sign reading ""Defy Martial Law"" was placed in front of the speaker’s podium.
After the group watched a precorded praise video, Bundy briefly addressed the group, saying, ""When you believe in Christ ...
you will never infringe upon your neighbor's rights."" There were no signs on the livestream of anyone attempting to challenge or interrupt the service.
Wayne Hoffman with the conservative Idaho Freedom Foundation – a group that has called the ban on gatherings unconstitutional – also was invited to speak.
Bundy did not officially announce the venue for the service until just hours before it started.
He told CNN last week he wasn’t concerned about getting coronavirus.

Asked at a news conference Monday if Louisiana would follow suit if President Trump announced plans to loosen or lift Covid-19 social distancing guidelines, Gov. John Bel Edwards said it is too early to know, but that he would be working with the White House coronavirus task force.
“Well, it's just too early to know and (Trump) is talking about some time after April the 30th; don't know exactly what timeline that looks like and he's also indicated that what he does may not be uniformly implemented in all states at the same time, because you have ...
some states that are obviously more impacted than others,"" he said, adding that Louisiana is one of those hotspots.
Edwards went on to say that he would be working with Trump and the task force.
Singapore reported 386 new cases of novel coronavirus on Monday.
It's the largest single-day increase since the outbreak began in the country, according to the Ministry of Health.
This brings the country's total to 2,918, with all the new cases identified as locally transmitted cases, the ministry said.
Among the new cases, 280 have been linked to known clusters, of which the vast majority are foreign workers residing in dormitories.
Meanwhile, a 65-year-old male has died of complications resulting from coronavirus Monday, bringing the national death toll to nine.
During Monday's task force briefing, the White House presented a digital montage of TV and radio clips of President Trump’s early actions with the coronavirus.
One clip featured audio from New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, who can be heard describing how the President was criticized for his early travel ban from China.
Facts First: The Haberman quotes are misleading as they edit out one of her key points: that the President’s travel restriction was one of the last actions he took to address the coronavirus for weeks.
“At the end of the day, it was probably effective, because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus.
The problem is, it was one of the last things that he did for several weeks.” According to the transcript, the Daily’s host Michael Barbaro asks a follow up question: “So the right decision in retrospect, but not accompanied by similar actions that might have contained transmission.” Haberman responded: “That’s exactly right.
Bush was criticized for his “Mission Accomplished” banner about Iraq, the president treated that moment as if it was his mission accomplished moment.
And it basically squandered several weeks within the US.” As Haberman pointed out on Twitter, she went on to say that the President “treated that travel limitation as a Mission Accomplished moment,” harkening back to former President George W.
President Trump lashed out at criticism of his handling of the coronavirus crisis during a grievance-fueled appearance from the White House.
The appearance only affirmed the impression that some of Trump's chief concerns amid the global public health disaster are how his performance is viewed in the media and whether he's being fairly judged.
He clearly did not believe that was the case Monday.
He stepped to the podium armed with a video meant to frame his response in a positive light after his initial handling of the crisis has come under increasing scrutiny.
After it aired, Trump grew increasingly irate as reporters probed the time line of his response, claiming the criticism wasn't fair and that he'd handled the outbreak effectively.
""Everything we did was right,"" Trump insisted after an extended tirade against negative coverage.
Pressed later about his authority to reopen parts of the country, Trump delivered an eyebrow-raising statement asserting absolute control over the country.
He later added he would issue reports backing up his claim, which legal experts say isn't supported by the Constitution.
California will spend $42 million to protect foster kids and vulnerable families during the coronavirus pandemic.
Much of that money will be spent on 59,000 youth in foster care across the state, and by providing an extra $200 per month for the 25,000 most at-risk families in an effort to help keep vulnerable families together.
Other programs receiving extra funding include family resource centers, expanding telephone helplines, and providing laptops and cell phones for foster children in need of that technology.
Gov. Gavin Newsom described how he grew up in a family with his foster brother, Steven Ashby.
He noted that caring for at-risk children is a challenge, especially because visits from Child Protective Services are limited under the stay-at-home orders.
Without school and other activities, reports are down, the governor said.
The timeline for emancipation of teens aging out of the system will be extended, permitting them to remain in foster care for the time being.
Responding to criticism of his administration's response to the coronavirus, President Donald Trump touted his decision to limit travel from areas which had more coronavirus cases than the US at the time.
Trump told reporters Monday, ""I did a ban on China, you think that was easy?
Then I did a ban on Europe and many said it was an incredible thing to do."" Asked later about whether he’d be willing to lift travel restrictions as part of opening up the country, Trump added, “Right now we have a very strong ban.
We will keep it that way until they heal.” Facts First: It's misleading to call the travel restrictions Trump announced against China and Europe a ban because they contained multiple exemptions.
Only foreign nationals who had been in China, Europe's Schengen area, the UK or Ireland within the past 14 days are outright banned from entering the US.
As of February 2, US citizens who had been in China's Hubei province in the two weeks prior to their return to the United States are subject to a mandatory quarantine of up to 14 days upon their return to the US.
American citizens returning from the rest of mainland China may also face up to 14 days of quarantine after undergoing health screenings at selected ports of entry.
The broader European travel suspension Trump announced on March 11 applied to the 26 countries in the Schengen area, a European zone in which people can move freely across internal borders without being subjected to border checks.
While Trump initially identified the United Kingdom as exempt, additional countries that are not in the Schengen area and thus also exempt from the restrictions include Ireland, Croatia, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Serbia, Armenia, Montenegro, Belarus and Russia.
As of March 14, the ban was expanded to include foreign nationals traveling from UK and Ireland.
The restrictions also did not apply to US citizens returning from Europe as well as permanent US residents and certain family members of both citizens and permanent residents.

A study by the Italian Health Institute (ISS) analyzed the characteristics of the evolution of the Covid-19 infection in Italy and concluded it bore similarities to what happened in Wuhan, China.
The report says the Italian cluster ""showed worse clinical outcomes"" in elderly males with previous health conditions, resembling the most at risk patients in Wuhan.
According to the institute, the initial reproduction number or R0 — the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person — was 2.96 in the region of Lombardy, one of the most affected.
Silvio Brusaferro, head of the ISS had said during his weekly briefing that R0 levels should ideally be below one to flatten the Covid-19 curve.
""Initial R0 at 2.96 in Lombardia, explains the high case-load and rapid geographical spread observed.
Overall Rt [the virus' transmission rate at a given time] in Italian regions is currently decreasing albeit with large diversities across the country, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures,"" the report says.
In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the NFL and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) have reached an agreement on modifications to the rules regarding offseason workout programs and minicamps.
CNN has obtained a memo of those changes, dated Monday, from the NFL Management Council to chief executives, presidents, general managers and head coaches.
Starting next week, there will be a “Virtual Period” portion of the offseason program while team facilities remain closed, and later there will be an “On-Field Period” for when team facilities reopen.
The virtual period will start April 20 until May 15.
During the virtual period, teams can conduct classroom instruction, workouts, and non-football educational programs using Skype, or any other appropriate platform, on a “virtual” basis.
When team facilities reopen for the on-field period, teams may resume offseason workout programs, including all permissible on-field activities, under the customary rules in the collective bargaining agreement.
The reopening of team facilities will occur in accordance with protocols established by the NFL, conforming with federal, state and local rules and regulations, and only after consultation with the NFLPA, which will be made widely known to teams at the appropriate time.
If one or more NFL team facility remain closed for any period of time, all team facilities will remain closed during that period.
As it has been in previous years, the program is voluntary to players.
Veteran players who participate are to be paid the $235 daily minimum amount, and players with offseason workout bonuses must be credited for their participation in those sessions.
Each team may elect to continue its offseason workout program beginning May 18, either under a virtual format or under an on-field format, depending upon conditions.
The virtual period will end and the on-field period will begin for all teams at any point during the offseason workout program when all NFL team facilities have reopened.
All offseason workout programs end for all teams on June 26.",2020-04-12,"['news', 'conference', 'suit', 'plan', 'work', 'task', 'force', 'talk', 'time', 'state', 'time', 'state', 'impact', 'work', 'task', 'force', 'report', 'case', 'day', 'increase', 'country', 'health', 'country', 'case', 'transmit', 'case', 'case', 'cluster', 'worker', 'dormitory', 'complication', 'result', 'death', 'toll', 'task', 'force', 'briefing', 'montage', 'tv', 'action', 'feature', 'times', 'reporter', 'criticize', 'travel', 'fact', 'point', 'travel', 'restriction', 'action', 'address', 'week', 'end', 'day', 'measure', 'virus', 'problem', 'thing', 'week', 'host', 'question', 'decision', 'action', 'transmission', 'criticize', 'mission', 'banner', 'treat', 'moment', 'mission', 'moment', 'week', 'point', 'treat', 'travel', 'limitation', 'mission', 'moment', 'criticism', 'crisis', 'grievance', 'fuel', 'impression', 'concern', 'health', 'disaster', 'performance', 'view', 'case', 'step', 'podium', 'arm', 'response', 'light', 'crisis', 'increase', 'scrutiny', 'air', 'reporter', 'time', 'line', 'response', 'claim', 'criticism', 'press', 'part', 'country', 'eyebrow', 'statement', 'country', 'issue', 'report', 'claim', 'expert', 'support', 'kid', 'family', 'money', 'youth', 'care', 'state', 'month', 'risk', 'family', 'help', 'family', 'program', 'funding', 'family', 'resource', 'telephone', 'cell', 'phone', 'child', 'technology', 'family', 'brother', 'care', 'risk', 'child', 'challenge', 'child', 'services', 'home', 'order', 'school', 'activity', 'report', 'emancipation', 'age', 'system', 'permit', 'care', 'time', 'criticism', 'administration', 'response', 'decision', 'travel', 'area', 'case', 'time', 'reporter', 'thing', 'travel', 'restriction', 'part', 'opening', 'country', 'way', 'fact', 'call', 'travel', 'restriction', 'area', 'day', 'citizen', 'week', 'return', 'states', 'day', 'return', 'citizen', 'return', 'rest', 'mainland', 'face', 'day', 'health', 'screening', 'port', 'entry', 'travel', 'suspension', 'country', 'area', 'people', 'border', 'border', 'country', 'area', 'restriction', 'travel', 'restriction', 'citizen', 'return', 'resident', 'family', 'member', 'citizen', 'resident', 'travel', 'restriction', 'study', 'health', 'evolution', 'infection', 'similarity', 'report', 'cluster', 'health', 'condition', 'risk', 'reproduction', 'number', 'number', 'people', 'person', 'region', 'silvio', 'head', 'briefing', 'level', 'curve', 'case', 'load', 'virus', 'transmission', 'rate', 'time', 'region', 'diversity', 'country', 'support', 'importance', 'measure', 'report', 'response', 'players', 'agreement', 'modification', 'rule', 'regard', 'program', 'change', 'date', 'management', 'manager', 'head', 'coach', 'week', 'period', 'portion', 'program', 'team', 'facility', 'field', 'period', 'team', 'facility', 'period', 'period', 'team', 'conduct', 'classroom', 'instruction', 'football', 'program', 'use', 'platform', 'basis', 'team', 'facility', 'field', 'period', 'team', 'resume', 'program', 'field', 'activity', 'rule', 'bargaining', 'agreement', 'team', 'facility', 'accordance', 'state', 'rule', 'regulation', 'consultation', 'team', 'time', 'team', 'facility', 'period', 'time', 'team', 'facility', 'period', 'year', 'program', 'player', 'veteran', 'player', 'amount', 'player', 'bonus', 'credit', 'participation', 'session', 'team', 'program', 'format', 'field', 'format', 'condition', 'period', 'end', 'field', 'period', 'team', 'point', 'program', 'team', 'facility', 'program', 'end', 'team']"
